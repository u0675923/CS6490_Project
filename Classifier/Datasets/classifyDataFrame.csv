dear 
friend,a recent survey by nielsen/netratings says that ""the internet 
population is rapidly approaching a 'half a billion' people!""so what 
does all this mean to you? easy money!!let's assume that every person 
has only one e-mail address...that's 500 million potential customers and 
growing!ï¿½ in addition,e'mail is without question the most powerful 
method of distributinginformation on the face of the earth.well, i 
think you get the picture.ï¿½ the numbers and potential are just 
staggering, but it gets even better...suppose i told you that you could 
start your own e-mail businesstoday and enjoy these 
benefits:ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ *** all customers pay you in 
cash!!!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ *** you will sell a product which costs 
nothing to produce!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ *** your only overhead is your 
time!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ *** you have 100s of millions of potential 
customers!!!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ *** you get detailed, easy to follow 
startup 
instructions!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and 
this is just the tip of the iceberg . . .as you read on you'll discover how 
a 'seen on national tv' program is paying out a half million dollars, every 
4 to 5 monthsfrom your home, for an investment of only $25 us dollars 
expense,one time.ï¿½ all thanks to the computer age . . . and the 
internet!before you say ""bull"", please read the following:this is 
the letter you have been hearing about on the newslately.ï¿½ due to the 
popularity of this letter on the internet,a national weekly news program 
recently devoted an entireshow to the investigation of this program 
described below,to see if it really can make people money.the show 
also investigated whether or not the program waslegal.ï¿½ their findings 
proved once and for all that there are""absolutely no laws prohibiting the 
participation in theprogram and if people can follow the simple 
instructions,they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out 
ofpocket cost"".ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ due to the recent increase 
of popularityï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and respect this program has 
attained,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ it is currently working better than 
ever!***** this is what one had to say:""thanks to this 
profitable opportunity.ï¿½ i was approached manytimes before but each 
time i passed on it.ï¿½ i am so glad ifinally joined just to see what one 
could expect in returnfor the minimal effort and money required.ï¿½ to my 
asonishment,i received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money 
stillcoming 
in"".ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ pam 
hedland,ï¿½ fort lee, new 
jersey----------------------------------------------------------------here 
is another testimonial:""this program has been around for a long time but 
i neverbelieved in it.ï¿½ but one day when i received this again in 
the mail i decided to gamble my $25 on it.ï¿½ i followed thesimple 
instructions and walaa. . . .ï¿½ 3 weeks later the moneystarted to come 
in.ï¿½ first month i only made $240.00 but thenext 2 months after that i 
made a total of $290,000.00.so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, i have made over $710,000.00 and i am playing it again.the 
key to success in this program is to follow the simplesteps and not change 
anything.""more testimonials later but first:** print this now 
for your future referenceif you would like to make at least $500,000 
every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following . . 
.then read it again and again!!!**follow these simple 
instructions,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ to make your financial dreams 
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ come 
true**instructions:-------------------***** order all 5 reports 
shown on the list below.***** for each report, send $5 us cash, the name 
& number of the report you are ordering andyour e-mail address to 
the person whose name appearson that list next to the 
report.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ make sure your return address is on 
yourï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ envelope top left corner in case of any 
mailï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ problems.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 
*****when you place your order, make 
sureï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 
you order each of the 5 reports *****you will need all 5 reports so that 
you can save them on yourcomputer and resell them.your total cost $5 
x 5 = $25.00**********within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, 
eachof the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.ï¿½ savethem 
on your computer so they will be accessible for you tosend to the 1,000's of 
people who will order them from you.also make a floppy of these reports and 
keep it at your deskin case something happens to your 
computer.**********important - do not alter the names of the 
peoplewho are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, 
in any way other than what is intructed below in steps1 through 6 or you 
will lose out on the majority of your profits.once you understand the way 
this works, you will also see howit does not work if you change 
it.remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,it will 
not work!!!people have tried to put their friends/relatives names 
onall five thinking they could get all the money.ï¿½ but it doesnot 
work this way.ï¿½ believe us, we have tried to be greedyand then nothing 
happened.so do not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed.because if you do, it will not work for you.ï¿½ 
remember,honesty reaps the reward!!!1. after you have ordered all 5 
reports, take this advertisement and remove the name and address of the 
person inreport # 5.ï¿½ this person has made it through the cycle and is 
no doubt counting their fortune.2. move the name & address in 
report #4 down to report #5.3. move the name & address in report #3 down 
to report #4.4. move the name & address in report #2 down to report 
#3.5. move the name & address in report #1 down to report #2.6. 
insert your name & address in the report #1 position.please make 
sure you copy every name & 
addressaccurately!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------take 
this entire letter, with the modified list of names,and save it on your 
computer.ï¿½ do not make any otherchanges.ï¿½ save this on a disk as 
well just in case you looseany data.to assist you with marketing 
your business on the internet,the 5 reports you purchase will provide you 
with invaluablemarketing information that includes:ï¿½ how to send bulk 
e-mailslegally, where to find thousand of free classified ads and much, 
much more.there are 2 primary methods to get this venture 
going:ï¿½ï¿½ method #1:ï¿½ sending bulk e-mail 
legallyï¿½ï¿½ 
---------------------------------------------------------let's say that you 
decide to start small, just to see howit goes, and we'll assume you and 
those involved send outonly 5,000 emails each.ï¿½ let's also assume that 
the mailingreceives only a 0.2% response (the response could be 
muchbetter but lets just say it is only 0.2%.ï¿½ also, many 
peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead ofonly 
5,000 each).continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 
e-mails.with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.those 
10 people resonded by sending out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 
50,000.ï¿½ out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with 
orders.ï¿½ that's 100 people responded andordered report #2.ï¿½ those 
100 people mail out 5,000 e-mailseach for a total of 500,000 e-mails.ï¿½ 
the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for report #3.thoe 1000 
people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of5 million e-mails sent 
out.ï¿½ the 0.2% response to that is10,000 orders for report #4.ï¿½ 
those 10,000 people send out5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 
million)e-mails.ï¿½ the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
forreport #5.that's 100,000 orders times $5 each = 500,000(a 
half a million).ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ your total income in this 
example is:ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 1......$50 +ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 
2......$500 +ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 3......$5,000 
+ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 4......$50,000 +ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 
5......$500,000 .................. grand total = 
$555,550.00ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ numbers do not lie.ï¿½ get a 
pencil & paper andï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ figure out the worst possible 
responses and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ no matter how you calculate it, you 
willï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ still make a lot of 
money!----------------------------------------------------------------------ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 
remember friend, this is assuming only 10ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ people 
ordering out of 5,000 people you mailed.dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone,or 1/2, or even 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mailseach or more?ï¿½ there are over 250 million people on the 
internet worldwide and counting.ï¿½ believe me, many peoplewill do 
just that, and more!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ method #2:ï¿½ placing 
free ads on the internetï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 
---------------------------------------------------------------------advertising 
on the net is very, very inexpensive and thereare hundreds of free places to 
advertise.ï¿½ placing a lot offree ads on the internet will easily get a 
larger response.we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add 
method# 2 as you go along.for every $5 you receive, all you must do 
is e-mail them the report they ordered.ï¿½ that's it!ï¿½ always 
provide same dayservice on all orders.ï¿½ this will guarantee that the 
e-mailsthey send out, with your name and address on it, will beprompt 
because they can not advertise until they receive 
thereport.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ order each report by it number 
& name only.note:ï¿½ always send $5 cash (us currency) for each 
report.checks are not accepted.ï¿½ make sure the cash is wrapped inat 
lease 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope.on one of those 
sheets of paper, write the number and the nameof the report you are 
ordering, your email address, your nameand postal address.ï¿½ make sure 
you affix the proper 'international'postage if ordering a report from 
outside your country.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ place your order for these 
reports

lagos - nigeria.
your kind attn.,re: request for mutually benefitting endeavour.i humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this
mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, i apologize in advance.i am barrister kola owolabi( attorney at law), i
represent alhaji ishmaila ibrahim gwarzoâ€™s estates. alhaji gwarzo was the chief
security advicer of the then military leader of this country(nigeria) in the
person of late general sani abacha who died on the 8th of june 1998. with the
advent of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of
gen. olusegun obasanjo (rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he
held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of
his village.the main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a
business proposal that might be of interest to you. my
client has informed me of the existence of funds
deposited with a security company abroad. this fund
came about as part of security votes that were
allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure
as chief security adviser to the then president. what
happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the central bank of nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the
then president. but before the purchase could take
place the president died. my client has decided to
keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. but due to his
incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.i have been mandated by my client to source for a
foreign partner that can help him facilitate the
change of possession. the deposit certificate and the
code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in
my possession.the funds in question is usd17.6m (seventeen million, six hundred thousand
united states dollars only). should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.i remain most obliged.barrister kola owolabi(jp).

1,"dear sir,i am dr james alabi, the chairman of contract
award and review committee set up by the federal
government of nigeria under the new civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.
i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge
sum of money to a foreign account. there were series of contracts executed by a 
consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in
favor of n.n.p.c. the original values of these 
contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum
of us$12,320,000.00 (twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand 
united
state dollars). this amount has now been approved and
is now ready to be transferred being that the
companies
that actually executed these contracts have been
fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. 
consequently, my colleagues and i are willing to 
transfer the total amount to your account for
subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants
are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil
service law) from operating and/or opening foreign 
accounts in our names. needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in 
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 
transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for
incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will
be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts
in due course. modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the ministry of finance and the central bank of 
nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds
within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of
the above stated terms. 
our assurance is that your role is risk free. to accord this transaction the legality it deserves and
for mutual security of the funds the whole approval
procedures will officially and legally processed
with your name or the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonefide beneficiary. 
once more i want you to understand that having put
in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my
country, i am averse to having my image and career 
dented. this matter should therefore be treated with
utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. please you should signify your intention to assist
by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this
transaction, if favorable we will take further steps
to brief you the full details of this viable 
transaction. 
i want to assure you that this business proposal is
100% risk free as we have done our homework
properly. i quite believe that you will protect our interest
by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are
still in government service, which we intend to
retire from in full honor.kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the next batch
which would constitute the new quarter payments
for the 2002 financial year. thank you and god bless.dr james alabi",0,0,0

end of list of five names*********************step 2.  these guides will be emailed to you.  save these
guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the guides to the new buyers.step 3.  from the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under guide#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from guide #4's
slot.  be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
check the address again.step 4.  delete name and address under guide #4, and
replace with the name and address from guide #3's slot.step 5.  delete name and address under guide #3, and
replace with the name and address from  guide#2's slot.step 6.  delete name and address under guide #2, and
replace with the name and address from guide #1's slot.step 7.  delete name and address under guide #1, and
replace with your own name and address. this
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the guides. eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached guide #5, and then be dropped from the list. the
key point is that the number of people ordering guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.step 8.  once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under guide #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  the greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the guide #1 from you.  these people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under guide #2, and so on.this is all you need to do.  if you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  if not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the guides from you to send out
emails of their own.do not change anything other than what is instructed.
because if you do, it will not work for you.  your immediate
reaction might be: why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
that might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  but
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
what will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. if the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  there
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. so, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  don't
do it to others. remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!you may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the guide.  well, rest
assured.  as we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  so don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  the people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered guide to the buyer.  don't cheat.
provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******end of summary************************=======rest of message======================with easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
and the earnings potential is staggering!read this email to the end! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
recession is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  yes, i know what you are thinking. i never
responded to one of these before either. one day though,
something made me feel: ""you use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  why the heck not?""  no matter where
you believe those ""feelings"" came from, i thank every day
that feeling came over me.i cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be doing
had i not. read on. it works.  and when you read the guides,
youâ’ll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
what can be better?  a way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
if you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  if you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.= print this message for future reference =if you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.follow the simple instruction above and
your financial dreams can come true!remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will not work!  this is a legitimate business. you
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.===========================================
*** take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. do not make any other
changes.  there are 2 methods to get this venture going:method # 1: by sending bulk email legally
===========================================let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for guide # 1. those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
that's 25 people who responded and ordered guide # 2.those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. the 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for guide # 3. those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. the 0.1% response
is 625 orders for guide # 4.those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. the 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per guide.  this
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  see what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.if response rate is 0.1%, income from guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)if response rate is 0.15%, income from guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795if response rate is 0.2%, income from guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  from the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.there are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.method # 2: placing free ads on the internet
===========================================advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
many free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. we strongly suggest you start
with  method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along.
for every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
guide the buyer ordered. always provide same day service.the people you buy these guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  in return, when others buy the guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the guides to
their email addresses.  this will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  this is no different than ""customer
service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.===========available guides ==============
the reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  ""wrong"". it is simply about time. time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. concealing it
is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.order each guide by its number & name only.
always send a single $10 bill (u.s. currency) for each
guide.  checks not accepted. make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. on one of
those sheets of paper, write the number & the name
of the guide you are ordering, your email address
and your name and postal address.  be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.place your order for these guides now
from the name and address list shown
at the beginning of this email
________________________________________________
your success guidelines=== if you do not receive at least 10 orders for guide #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.=== two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
you should receive 100 orders or more for guide #2. if
not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.once you have received 100 or more orders for guide # 2,
you can see the program is working, and
cash should continue coming in! this is important
to remember:  continue to assist new buyers with advice
and instruction on how to send out more emails. you can
keep track of progress by noting which guides people
are ordering from you. if you want to generate
more income send another batch of emails
and start the whole process again.
there is no limit to the income you can generate !!!
===========================================

under the budget allocation to our ministry. this 
bill has been approved for payment by the other concerned ministries. the
contract has since been executed, 
commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract.
we are left with the balance us$20.5m as part 
of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for
our own use. but under our protocol division, we 
as civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. this
is why we are soliciting your assistance in this

ministry. we have been exercising patience for this 
opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity
we cannot afford to miss.we have agreed to compensate you duly if agreement is reached by both of
us and i and one of my colleagues 
involved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,
upon the confirmation from you that the certified 
international bank draft has been approved and raised in your favor.consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your
interest by telephone to me, through my direct tel

ch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. if you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . upon your response, i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.awaiting your urgent reply via my email: thanks and regards. mr.ike ejoh

everything to lose weight.â  i know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds i needed to lose
either.â  it seemed like the harder i worked at it, the less
weight i lost - until i heard about 'extreme power plus'.you're probably thinking to yourself, ""oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""â  like you, i was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so i told her i'd give it a try.â  i mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!â  let me tell you, it was
the best decision i've ever made.  period.  six months later,
as i'm writing this message to you, i've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and i haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.â  yes, i still eat pizza, and lots of it!i was so happy with the results that i contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a huge discount.â i feel
the need to help other people lose weight like i did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
i am giving you my personal pledge that 'extreme power plus'
absolutely will work for you. 100 % money-back guaranteed!if you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then i recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'extreme power plus'!you're probably asking yourself, ""ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""extreme power plus contains lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid

parents of 15 - year old - find $71,000 cash hidden in
his closet!does this headline look familiar? of course it does. you most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (usa).
and reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -
new zealand). his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old
sons closet. nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. five-dollar bills, twenties,
fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.""my first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old
woman, ""there was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my
husband earns in a year"".the woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where
he worked to tell him what she had discovered.he came home right away
and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  little did
they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet.as it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via e-mail, a type of 
""report"" to e-mail addresses that he obtained off the internet. everyday
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom.""i just got the e-mail one day and i figured what the heck, i put my name
on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out"", says the clever
15-year-old.the e-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top
and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to
the top of the list.the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""i get junk e-mail all the time, and
really did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues.within the first few days of sending out the e-mail, the post office box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.""about a week later i rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box
had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. there was also a
yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [post office] counter. i thought i
was in trouble or something (laughs)"". he goes on, ""i went up to the
counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. i had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all"".  over
the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the e-mail.""  the
money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet, barely had time for my homework"".he had also been riding his bike
to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, 
fifties and hundreds.""i didn't want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks
with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. i would usually tell the
lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money] and he was outside waiting for me.one time the lady gave me a
really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
and my dad would have to come in and do it, but i just rode to the next
bank down the street (laughs).""  surprisingly, the boy did not have any
reason to be afraid.the reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.in fact, it was
completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws, title 18,
section 1302 and 1341, or title 18, section 3005 in the us code, also in
the code of federal regulations, volume 16, sections 255 and 436, which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,
""please send me report number xyx"".this simple note made the letter
legal because he was exchanging a service (a report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee.[this is the end of the media release. if you would like to understand how
the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. what 
appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
 you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions].+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
be financially free like others within a year!!! before you
say ""bull"", please read the following. this is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on the
 internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire
show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
can make people money. the show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal. their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some
megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".
due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this
program has attained, it is currently working better
than ever.
note* follow the directons below, i had best results the second time when
i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.in order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so
that the returns are many. i have been extremely successful using the
following company. they send out the offers, and all i do is accept money
for reports, then i send back to the people as soon as possible.this is what one had to say: ""thanks to this profitable opportunity. i was 
approached many times before but each time i passed on it. i am so glad i
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required. to my astonishment, i received total
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in"".pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
here is another testimonial: ""this program has been around for a long time 
but i never believed in it. but one day when i received this again in the
mail i decided to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the simple instructions
and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. first month i
only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of
$290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, i
have made over $710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the key to
success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change
anything."" more testimonials later but first,print this now for your future reference++++ order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++
for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the 
report you are ordering and your e-mail address to the
person whose name appears on that list next to the report. make
sure your return address is on your envelope top left
 corner in case of any mail problems. when you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.
you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.
within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
these 5 different individuals. save them on your computer so they will be
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from
you. also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.
important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step ""1 through 6"" or you will loose out on majority of
your profits. once you understand the way this works, you will also see
how it does not work if you change it. remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter, it will not work!!! people have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.
but it does not work this way. believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened. so do not try to change anything other than
what is instructed. because if you do, it will not work for you. remember,
honesty reaps the reward!!!
1.... after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
remove the name & address of the person in report # 5. this person
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... move the name & address in report # 4 down to report #5.
3.... move the name & address in report # 3 down to report #4.
4.... move the name & address in report # 2 down to report #3.
5.... move the name & address in report # 1 down to report #2
6.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.
please make sure you copy every name & address accurately!

**** take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on
your computer. do not make any other changes. save this on a
disk as well just in case if you loose any data. to assist you with marketing
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much
more. there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:
method #1: by sending bulk e-mail legally
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will
assume you and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. let's
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.
with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. that equals
100 people responded and ordered report # 2.those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.
the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for report #3.those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million
e-mails sent out. the 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for report #4.those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000
orders for report #5. that's 100,000 orders times
$5 each=$500,000.00 (half million). your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......
grand total=$555,550.00
numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and figure out
the worst possible responses and no matter how you
calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people
ordering out of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think for a moment
what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people
mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? there are over 150 million people on 
the internet worldwide and counting. believe me, many people will do just
that, and more!
method #2: by placing free ads on the internet
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response.
we strongly suggest you start with method #1 and add method #2 as
you go along. for every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
report they ordered. that's it. always provide same day service on all
orders. this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name
and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
receive the report.=order each report by its number & name only. notes: always
send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not
accepted. make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper or aluminum foil. on one of those sheets of paper, write
the number & the name of the report you are ordering, your e-mail 
address and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:+++ if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2 weeks,
continue sending e-mails until you do. =orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
report #2. if you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until
you do.+++ once you have received 100 or more orders for report #2, you can
relax, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will
continue to roll in! this is important to remember: every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different
report. you can keep track of your progress by watching which
report people are ordering from you. if you want to generate
more income send another batch of e-mails and start
the whole process again. there is no limit to the income you
can generate from this business!!!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
following is a note from the originator of this
program: you have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with no risk and just a
little bit of effort. you can make more money in the next few
weeks and months than you have ever imagined. follow the program
exactly as instructed. do not change it in any way. it works
exceedingly well as it is now.remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your
name and address in report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as
instructed above. one of the people you send this to may send out
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.
remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers
you will reach. so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information, 
materials and opportunity to become financially independent. 
it is up to you now!++++++++++++++++ more testimonials ++++++++++++++++
""my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in chicago. i am an
accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make pretty good money.
when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving 
""junk mail"". i made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages involved. i ""knew"" it wouldn't work. jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
with both feet. i made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
""i told you so"" on her when the thing didn't work. well, the laugh was on
me! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. within the next 45
days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! i was shocked.
i have joined jody in her ""hobby"".mitchell wolf, chicago, illinois+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
""not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. but conservative that i am, i decided that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back"". ""i was
surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with
orders. i made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. the nice thing about
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. there simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big"".dan sondstrom, alberta, canada+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
""i had received this program before. i deleted it, but later i wondered if i
should have given it a try. of course, i had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed again by someone
else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... i did not delete
this one! i made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money
came within 22 weeks"".susan de suza, new york, n.y+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

the fact is that mlm is fatally flawed, meaning that it cannot work for most people. 
the companies and the few who earn the big money in mlm are not going to tell you the real story. finally, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the truth about mlm. here's good news there is an alternative to mlm that works, and works big! if you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! with your permission, i'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you why mlm doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. i promise that there will be no unwanted follow up, no sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. period. to receive this free, life-changing information, simply click reply, type ""send info"" in the subject box and hit send. i'll get the information to you within 24 hours. just look for the words mlm wall of shame in your inbox. cordially, mark r sherman p.s. someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information i have ever received. i honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. and it's free!

1,"the ultimate way to work from home 
the best money making system of all!! 
as seen on national tv 
as seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. this is not a scam. 
i hope this is ok that i send you this. if you aren't interested, just 
simply delete it. 
read this message if you are like me and want more than your lousy 
weekly paycheck. make more in a few months than last year at work. 
believe it, work it. 
this really works, don't make the same mistake i made. i deleted this 
4-5 times before finally giving it a try. within 2 weeks the orders 
(money) 
started coming in just like the plan below said it would. give it a 
try!! 
you will be glad you did. 
thanks and good luck! you won't need luck, just keep reading. don't 
delete this!!! 
------------------------------------------------------ 
first read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. see below.... 
as seen on national tv: this is the media report. 
parents of 15 - year old - find $71,000 cash hidden 
in his closet! 
does this headline look familiar? of course it does. 
you most likely have just seen this story recently 
featured on a major nightly news program (usa). 
and reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 
of the woods - new zealand). his mother was cleaning 
and putting laundry away when she came across a large 
brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 
15-year-old sons closet. 
nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got 
when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. 
five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - 
all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
""my first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", 
says the 41-year-old woman, ""there was over $71,000 
dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband 
earns in a year"". 
the woman immediately called her husband at the 
car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she 
had discovered. he came home right away and they 
drove together to the boys school and picked him up. 
little did they suspect that where the money came from 
was more shocking than actually finding it in 
the closet. 
as it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via 
e-mail, a type of ""report"" to e-mail addresses that he 
obtained off the internet. everyday after school for 
the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his 
computer in his bedroom. 
""i just got the e-mail one day and i figured what the 
heck, i put my name on it like the instructions said 
and i started sending it out"", says the clever 
15-year-old. 
the e-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 
instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person 
on the list, then delete the address at the top and 
move the others addresses down, and finally to add 
your name to the top of the list. 
the letter goes on to state that you would receive 
several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 
weeks if you sent out the letter with your 
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""i get junk 
e-mail all the time, and really did not think it was 
going to work"", the boy continues. 
within the first few days of sending out the e-mail, 
the post office box that his parents had gotten him 
for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to 
fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 
$5 bills. 
""about a week later i rode [my bike] down to the post 
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 
envelops stuffed in it. there was also a yellow slip 
that said i had to go up to the [post office] counter. 
i thought i was in trouble or something (laughs)"". he 
goes on, ""i went up to the counter and they had a 
whole box of more mail for me. i had to ride back 
home and empty out my backpack because i could not 
carry it all"". 
over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending 
out the e-mail. ""the money just kept coming in and i 
just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, 
barely had time for my homework"". he had also 
been riding his bike to several of the banks in his 
area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
and hundreds. 
""i didn't want the banks to get suspicious so i kept 
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a 
time in my backpack. i would usually tell the lady at 
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 
exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. 
one time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and 
my dad would have to come in and do it, but i just 
rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" 
surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be 
afraid. the reporting news team examined and 
investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was 
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter 
at all. in fact, it was completely legal according to 
us postal and lottery laws, title 18, section 1302 and 
1341, or title 18, section 3005 in the us code, also 
in the code of federal regulations, volume 16, 
sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
must be exchanged for money received. 
every five-dollar bill that he received contained a 
little note that read, ""please send me report number 
xyx"".this simple note made the letter legal because he 
was exchanging a service (a report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee. 
[this is the end of the media release. if you would 
like to understand how the system works and get your 
$71,000 - please continue reading. what appears below 
is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - 
you can use it too - just follow the simple 
instructions]. 
thanks to the computer age and the internet ! 
================================================== 
you will make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your 
home!! 
before you say ''bull'', please read the following. this is the 
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. due to the 
popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news 
program 
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
described below, to see if it really can make people money. the show 
also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal. 
their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely no 
laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. 
due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this 
program has 
attained, it is currently working better than ever. 
this is what one had to say: '' thanks to this profitable opportunity. 
i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it. i am so 
glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 
the minimal effort and money required. to my astonishment, i received 
total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 
pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey. 
=========================================================
=======here is 
another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a 
long time but i never believed in it. but one day when i received this 
again in the mail i decided to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the 
simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to 
come 
in. first month i only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that 
made a total of $290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering 
the 
program, i have made over $710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change 
anything.'' more testimonials later but first:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$ 
follow the simple instruction below and your financial 
dreams will come 
true, guaranteed! 
instructions: 
================order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
================= 
for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the report 
you are ordering and your e-mail address to the person whose 
name appears on that list next to the report. make sure your return 
address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail 
problems. 
=== when you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 
reports. 
you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. your total cost $5 x 5=$25.00. 
within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports 
from these 5 different individuals. save them on your computer so they will 
be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk 
in case something happens to your computer. 
important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed 
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other 
than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will 
loose out on majority of your profits. once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. remember, 
this 
method has been tested, and if you alter, it will not work !!! people 
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they 
could get all the money. but it does not work this way. believe us, we all 
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. so do not try to change 
anything other than what is instructed. because if you do, it will not 
work for you. 
remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
1.... after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and remove the name & address of the person in report #5. 
this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune. 
2.... move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5. 
3.... move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4. 
4.... move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3. 
5.... move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 
6.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position. 
please make sure you copy every name & address accurately! 
=========================================================
======= 
**** take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it 
on your computer. do not make any other changes. 
save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. to assist 
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which 
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of 
free 
classified ads and much more. there are 2 primary methods to get this 
venture going: 
method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally 
=========================================================
======= 
let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 
we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 
let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the 
response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. also many 
people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 
each).continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 
with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 
those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total 
of 50,000. 
out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. that's=100 
people responded and ordered report # 2. 
those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3. 
those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 
million e-mails sent out. the 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders 
for report! # 4. whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a 
total of 
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 
orders for 
report # 5 that's 100,000 orders times $5 each=$500,000.00 (half 
million). 
your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ grand 
total=$555,550.00 
numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and figure out the 
worst possibleresponses and no matter how you 
calculate it, you will still 
make a lot of money ! 
=========================================================
======= 
remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people ordering 
out 
of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think for a moment what would happen if 
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 
each or more? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide 
and counting. believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 
method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet 
=========================================================
======= 
advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 
hundreds of free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the 
internet will easily get a larger response. we strongly suggest you 
start with method # 1and add method # 2 as you go along. for every $5 you 
receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's 
it. always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your 
name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise 
until they receive the report. 
===================available reports 
========================== 
order each report by its number & name only. notes: always 
send 
$5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not accepted. make sure 
the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. on 
one of those sheets of paper, write the number & the name of the report you 
are ordering, 
your e-mail address and your name and postal address. 
place your order for these reports now :

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 
=== if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2 
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
=== after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2. if you did not, continue 
advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
=== once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2, you can 
relax, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will 
continue to roll in ! this is important to remember: every time your 
name 
is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. 
you can keep track of your progress by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. if you want to generate more income 
send 
another batch of e-mails and start the whole process 
again. there is no 
limit to the income you can generate from this business !!!

testimonials====================== 
'' my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in chicago. i am an 
accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make pretty good 
money. when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving 
''junk mail''. i made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of 
the population and percentages involved. i ''knew'' it wouldn't work. jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in 
with 
both feet. i made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
''i told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. well, the laugh was 
on me! 
within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she 
had 
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! i was shocked. ! i have 
joined 
jody in her ''hobby''. 
mitchell wolf m.d., chicago, illinois 
=========================================================
======= '' not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. but conservative that i am, i decided 
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that 
i 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' i was 
surprised 
when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. i made 
$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. the nice thing about this deal is 
that it does not matter where people live. there simply isn't a better 
investment 
with a faster return and so big''. 
dan sondstrom, alberta, canada 
=========================================================
======= '' i had 
received this program before. i deleted it, but later i 
wondered if i should have given it a try. of course, i had no idea who 
to contact ! to get another copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed 
again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came 
again.....i did not delete this one! i made more than $490,000 on my 
first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. 
susan de suza, new york, n.y. 
=========================================================
====== 
'' it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. i followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. my first month i made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 
362,840.00. life is beautiful, thanx to internet''.

1,"attn:i am bulawa mulete jr. the son of mr. steve mbeki mulete from zimbabwe. i am sorry this mail
will surprise you, though we do not know, 
due to the current war against white farmers in
zimbabwe and the support of president robert mugabe to
claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
favor for re-election.all white farmers were asked to
surrender their farms to the government for
re-distribution and infact to his political party
members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
opposition party that did not support the president
idea. he then ordered his party members and the police
under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
down everything in the farm. they killed my
father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
after the death of my father, our local pastor and a
close friend of my father handed us over will
documents with instructions from my father that we
should leave zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. the will 
documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
to the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
easily be found by his enemies. the total amount is
us$21.5m.we are therefore soliciting for
your assistance to help us move the fund out of
zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. the president's present ban of
international press into zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
finance minister to avoid giving white farmers fund transfer
clearance above us$1m is just a few of the
unthinkable things he is committing in my country.
i have tried to reach my father's close friend mr.
john casahans from australia also a farmer who was
leaving in zimbabwe with us but left with his family
late last year following this ugly development to no
avail.
should you be interested to help us, contact me
immediately via email for easy communication and i
will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. we have concluded a wonderful plan of 
caring out the transfer within two weeks. please note that 
this transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
not endanger you or us in any way. we have resolved to give you 20%
of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
forward to coming over to your country to invest our
share and settle there. i will a private
phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.note: do reply to bulmulete@golfemail.com
god bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.mr. bulawa  mulete jr

1,"dear sir,,
my name is dr steven m duba , the son of mr. theo
duba of zimbabwe. i got your address from south
african information exchange johannesburg.
.due to the previous war against white farmers in
zimbabwe by president robert mugabe and his supporters
to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he
ordered all the white owned farmers to surrender all
their farms to his party members and his followers. my
father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman
behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our
country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the
presidnt mugabe. the presidentï¿½s supporters invaded my
fatherï¿½s farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested
him and confiscated all his investment.early last year when this victimization of white
farmers by president mugabe started, my late father
envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all
his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of
zimbabwe through diplomatic means to south africa.
when he arrived south africa, he lodged the box in a
private security company through the help of his
lawyer here in south africa without revealing the real
contents of the box to the security company, then,
went back home. he registered the box as family
treasure.while he was still in detention that led to his death
due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in south
africa because of the escalation of the crisis in
zimbabwe. he did not want my life to be in danger. he
was arrested on the 5th of march last year.
unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of
december 2001.i came to south africa march,2002.now my stay here in africa is frustrating and
depressing because my fatherï¿½s lawyer is presently
hospitalized in london due to terrible heart problem;
though the lodgment documents are with me, as such i
want to relocate to your country for good. presently,
my residence permit here in south africa is an asylum
permit as a refugee.i am seeking for your assistance in transferring the
money in the security company (us$15 million) out of
this country to your country for investment. if you
think you can help me, please try to get in touch with
me immediately with the  number below . your
compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated
if you are ready to assist me. since the problem in my
country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep
this information to yourself and secret, because i
wouldnï¿½t want anything that will expose me, and the
existence of this money.your urgent response will be highly appreciated.sincerely yours,steven duba (dr).tel:27-83-713-2696

till when things gets better. like now that president kabila is dead and the son taking over
(joseph kabila). one of my late husband's chateaux in southern france was confiscated by the french government, and as such i had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.i have deposited the sum eighteen million united state
dollars (us$18,000,000,00.) with a security company for safe keeping. what i want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that i can introduce you to my son (kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. i want you to assist in investing this money, but i will not want my identity revealed.i will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. may i at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which i repose in you.in conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.for this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.yours sincerely,mrs. mariam m. seseseko.--

previous news releases and announcements their statements are set forth in italicized orange type; our replies are in black type. june 4, 1999- sirs: the following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: 
""dom is located on karitane island and now includes the taongi atoll in the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the south pacific 1000 miles south of tahiti. however, the marshall islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the dom and sister nation, the kingdom of enenkio (the marshallese name for wake island), claiming to represent the mid-pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france- presse. the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation."" 
""a honolulu-based attorney created the ""kingdom of enenkio"" in the early 1990s. it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) 
the purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the kingdom of enenkio. while i am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the kingdom of enenkio, i am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. as a consequence of my service to his majesty king remios and the people of enenkio, i am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. i will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. for your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **dom is located on karitane island and now includes the taongi atoll in the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the south pacific 1000 miles south of tahiti.** (comment: the construction of this statement implies the marshall islands are in the south pacific ocean 1000 miles south of tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) 
correction: dom is located on karitane island in the south pacific, 1000 
miles south of tahiti, and now includes taongi atoll in the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the north pacific. **however, the marshall islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** 
(comment: just because the rmi government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...enenkio..."", does that make it true? why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? what purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) 
**...namely the dom and sister nation, the kingdom of enenkio (the marshallese name for wake island),...** 
(comment: nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for dom, but as for the kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, his majesty king remios, the sovereign of enenkio and eneen-kio atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
correction: the kingdom of enenkio is an independent sovereign state and 
the same could be said for dom. 
**...claiming to represent the mid-pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france- presse.** (comment: the government of the kingdom of enenkio represents the people of enenkio, who are forced to live in exile from eneen-kio atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. furthermore, ""...an article in agence france-presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the marshall islands government. my preceding comments apply. the kingdom of enenkio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". we have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of enenkio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. in fact, we are currently working with a former nasa astronaut. one tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
**the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** 
(comment: the kingdom of enenkio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which i am aware, and in my post, i am responsible for all published information. i would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if i had credible proof to that effect. however, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any rmi ministry source. furthermore, the rmi has repeatedly attacked the credibility of his majesty king hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the marshall islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. we believe some officials in the rmi are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. to perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **a honolulu-based attorney created the ""kingdom of enenkio"" in the early 1990s.** 
(comment: mr. moore is not an attorney, though he was living in honolulu in the early 1990s.) 
correction: the kingdom of enenkio was established by decree of the 
owner of eneen-kio atoll [a.k.a. enen-kio, halcyon, disclerta, wake and 6-8 other names], iroijlaplap murjel hermios, who then was paramount chief of the northern ratak atolls [he passed away in december 1998] and was fully recognized by the rmi government. he declared the sovereign state of enenkio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen-kio atoll, ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel (sic) hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** 
correction: the establishment of the kingdom of enenkio was made 
possible by murjel's appointment of mr. robert moore, the adopted brother of hermios, alab of taongi atoll and a private citizen, to the post of minister plenipotentiary. the document of appointment was also a special power of attorney which granted mr. moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the united states from eneen-kio atoll and establish an independent state on hermios' and the people's behalf. 
**the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (comment: since when is a special power of attorney an ""agreement""? the marshall islands high court has no record or knowledge of the special power of attorney, except as has been publicized by the kingdom of enenkio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over eneen-kio atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful rmi boundaries. the rmi has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the rmi when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch of eneen-kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) finally, i suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent u.s. invasion of eneen-kio atoll, properly named by 'marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. then i invite you to our embassy in honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. be sure to view the documents at our resource center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. in closing, i would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

june 3, 1999- sir: the following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the kingdom of enenkio (thank you for spelling 'enenkio' correctly. the purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the kingdom of enenkio. 
""fantasy island"" -- ""melchizedek passport scam reveals how the internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" by bertil lintner in bangkok, december 10, 1998: ""determined not to give up, pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to taongi atoll in the western pacific. according to a melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of enenkio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the u.s.-held wake island. in real life, taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the marshall islands."" 
http://www.feer.com/restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of december 24, 1998: ""fantasy island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) response to the author: i am unable to locate the ""melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of enenkio,..."". such an act would be impossible and implausible as enenkio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over taongi atoll in the marshall islands. further more, melchizedek (dom) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. 
the kingdom of enenkio did enter into a treaty with dom on the 19th day of september, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. it declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. however, a prior agreement, signed in may 1997, which had nothing to do with the kingdom of enenkio, transferred mr. robert moore's rights to develop taongi from mr. moore to dom. it did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. this was made possible because mr. moore is the alab (one class of landowner) of taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to taongi atoll, from the principal landowner, iroijlaplap (paramount chief) murjel hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by mr. moore, who is also the adopted brother of hermios. now, please understand, that while mr. moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of taongi, which would have generated an income to iroijlaplap hermios, mr. moore wears another hat as minister plenipotentiary of the kingdom of enenkio. iroijlaplap hermios, also wore (he died in december 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as first monarch, king of the kingdom of enenkio and one as owner in allodium of eneen-kio atoll (a.k.a. enen-kio, halcyon, disclerta, wake and several other names). for you to state the kingdom of enenkio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio. and, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon his majesty king hermios, the sovereign of enenkio and eneen-kio atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. i suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent u.s. invasion of eneen-kio atoll, properly named by 'marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. then i invite you to our embassy in honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: be sure to view the documents at our resource center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. in closing, i would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. skip to next file ï¿½top of page 
june 2, 1999- sir: the following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your footnotes to history -d and e (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""enenkio atoll- in 1898, the united states annexed wake island, in the marshall islands of the western pacific. after the marshalls became a u.s. trust territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that wake island was a part of the marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called enenkio locally. the u.s. government has consistently ignored these claims. the protests took a sharper turn after the u.s. congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by americans of the republic of hawai'i. king murjel hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern marshalls, declared wake island's independence in 1987. the marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. in return for his services as minister plenipotentiary in the united states, hermios granted american businessman robert moore land on taongi atoll in the northern marshalls, which moore has declared the dominion of melchizedek."" comment: with all candor, i cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. while i am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which i am assuming is not the case) in the history of the kingdom of enenkio, i am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. as a consequence of my service to his majesty king remios and the people of enenkio, i will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. for your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: 
**in 1898, the united states annexed wake island, in the marshall islands of the western pacific.** 
correction: in 1898, the united states invaded wake island, the 
northernmost atoll -- actually named eneen-kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the ratak chain of marshall islands in micronesia and the central north pacific ocean. the author responds: ""rest assured that i did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the american acquisition of the territory."" **after the marshalls became a u.s. trust territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that wake island was a part of the marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called enenkio locally.** correction: following w.w.ii, the trust territories of the pacific, which included the marshall islands, was placed under administration of the united states by the united nations. while eneen-kio was well established as one of the marshalls, the u.s. only knew it as wake and, having lost many u.s. lives there in 1941 at the hands of japanese invaders, kept control of it. in 1993, the paramount chief of the ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of eneen-kio atoll. 
the author responds: ""i don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" 
**the u.s. government has consistently ignored these claims.** correction: the u.s. government has consistently ignored claims from the marshall islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including iroijlaplap murjel hermios. the author responds: ""i will note this."" **the protests took a sharper turn after the u.s. congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by americans of the republic of hawai'i.** correction: the eneen-kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the u.s. congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the monarch of the kingdom of hawai'i by a group of american businessmen and u.s. marines, and in the following year returned the island of kaho'olawe to the hawaiian people. **king murjel hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern marshalls, declared wake island's independence in 1987.** correction: king murjel hermios, who was paramount chief until his death in december 1998, declared the sovereign state of enenkio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen-kio atoll, ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. 
the author responds: ""i will make the necessary corrections here."" **the marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. in return for his services as minister plenipotentiary in the united states, hermios granted american businessman robert moore land on taongi atoll in the northern marshalls, which moore has declared the dominion of melchizedek.** 
correction: after the death of the first monarch, his brother remios 
succeeded to the throne as second monarch and rules along with his brother, crown prince lobadreo, over the kingdom of enenkio today. to continue the commentary: the parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the kingdom of enenkio itself. since hm king remios also succeeded to iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the marshall islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. but that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the kingdom of enenkio. i have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. 
the author responds: ""i imagine that you are asserting here that moore's melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the sources & bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. be assured i will look further into\par this. thank you again for your response, captain rydell. i should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so.""

june 1, 1999: news release
part one background: 
on may 21, 1999, the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands posted a ""press release"" on the internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). the author, ""mr. joseph biglar, undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the kingdom of enenkio, nor with its monarch, his majesty king remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of enenkio. there is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. the republic of the marshall islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the kingdom of enenkio, headed by his majesty king remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be marshallese nationals residing in the marshall islands. response to so-called ""press release"": 
this unprovoked attack upon his majesty king remios, monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, by the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands is wholly false. it is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the republic of the marshall islands, which has been confirmed by the u.s. state department. (see: human rights report) this public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the marshall islands government that any attempt to interfere in the business of his majesty king remios, iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the marshall islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
the rmi is unequivocally cognizant that the kingdom of enenkio: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ exists as a sovereign state as defined by the montevideo convention (1933). 
ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, 
iroijlaplap murjel hermios, in 1987. 
ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was established by way of a public authority, the constitution 
of the kingdom of enenkio atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the dominion of melchizedek ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as 
- now quoting mr. biglar's statement - ""rmi geographical and political
boundaries."" 
ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and 
matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of marshallese customary law (reinforced by the rmi constitution), upon the acknowledged iroijlaplaps of the northern ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political 
jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll to the government or people of the dominion of melchizedek or to any other entity, including the republic of the marshall islands. 
mr. biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the republic of the marshall islands: 
ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the montevideo 
convention (1933). 
ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was conceived as a separate state by (un) foreign governments, 
which included the united states, china and the ussr. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was also established under a public authority, the constitution of the marshall islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has no relations with enenkio that allows rmi knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the dominion of melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the rmi to be condemned by mr. biglar. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll, which was not incorporated into the rmi in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ exercises authorities founded upon the rmi constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of eneen-kio atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the kingdom of 
enenkio in their every attempt to get the rmi government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of iroijlaplap hermios, and the rmi has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said iroijlaplap hermios. 
the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the republic of the marshall islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the kingdom of enenkio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the monarch of the kingdom, his majesty king remios, as head of state, the government of the kingdom of enenkio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. 
furthermore, in light of the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands announcement concerning the kingdom of enenkio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the preamble of the constitution of the marshall islands, then you decide for yourself: 
""with this constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" on behalf of his majesty king remios, we, administrators of the kingdom of enenkio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

[paragraph 4] thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging ofc. the newest ofcs, e.g., niue and the marshall islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the pacific. even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the dominion of malchizedek (sic) or the kingdom of enenkio atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: ofc = offshore financial center] response: this unprovoked attack upon his majesty king remios, monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, the sovereign state of enenkio and its noble citizenry by the u.s. department of state is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the kingdom of enenkio. it is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of his majesty king remios, the government of the kingdom of enenkio and organs thereof. 
the unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the united states to attempt to link the kingdom of enenkio with international crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. this public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the united states government that any attempt to interfere in the business of his majesty king remios, iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the marshall islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the president of the united states issues a formal apology to his majesty king remios, along with the government of the kingdom of enenkio, and the congress of the united states initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the united states of the islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll. congressional representatives to hawaii, the nearest state of the united states to eneen-kio atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. the united states is obligated as the self-assured trustee of pacific island states in micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to enenkio is no less. for further information and links to documents, see: enenkio documents http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/ml_intro.html http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/index.html march 16, 1999: news release 
the impact of the passing on december 10 of his majesty murjel hermios, first monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the marshall islands, beloved husband and father, was felt throughout the society.ï¿½ï¿½ flags were flown at half mast for a week 
in the marshalls and for a a month at enenkio consulates around the world.ï¿½ï¿½ his remains were interred in a remote site reserved for the highest ranking chiefs, according to marshallese custom. ï¿½ï¿½ his majesty king remios hermios

march 1999 -- comments to readers from the ministry of foreign affairs: subject: a ""state of war"" declaration the kingdom of enenkio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the united states government.ï¿½ï¿½ the united states government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and the law of nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the northern ratak state, which then had formal treaties with the republic of germany.ï¿½ï¿½ the explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many marshallese.ï¿½ï¿½ because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on marshallese society have not healed. thus a current state of adversity exists.ï¿½ï¿½ following four years of attempts to cause the united states to evaluate the plight of the marshallese of the northern ratak imposed by its actions with respect to wake island, the government of enenkio, on behalf of the marshallese king, issued the ""'state of war', a declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.ï¿½ï¿½ the people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.ï¿½ï¿½ it was through this pragmatic initiative that the kingdom of enenkio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the ratak paramount chief, king murjel hermios. in retrospect, the declaration has had little visible effect.ï¿½ï¿½ while a state of adversity does exist, the hope for american recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.ï¿½ï¿½ the kingdom of enenkio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.ï¿½ï¿½ such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.ï¿½ï¿½ the kingdom of enenkio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the marshallese people. 
while the kingdom of enenkio continues to seek accountability of the u.s. congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the un charter, conventions of the united nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the u.s. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.ï¿½ï¿½ the refusal of 
the u.s. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the marshallese people to whom the u.s. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the united nations and its members.ï¿½ï¿½ your understanding is appreciated.ï¿½ï¿½

december 19, 1998: news release 
subject: death of the monarch of the kingdom of enenkio 
the government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, his majesty king murjel hermios. embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 january 1999. memorial services, held in the marshall islands where hm hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional marshallese leaders. his remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. irooj hermios was head of state of the kingdom of enenkio, revered as monarch over the islands of eneen-kio atoll, esteemed as iroijlaplap and high chief of the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. his successor as iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a council of traditional leaders. selection of a successor to the monarchy of the kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. in the interim, a reagent will serve as head of state. hm hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as iroijlaplap. aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the marshalls, part of micronesia in the north pacific ocean and first discovered by european seamen in the 16th century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the marshall islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. today this area is commonly known as wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the united states. in one of the most courageous acts in recent times, irooj hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of eneen-kio atoll for his beloved people. (the account of his acts to establish the kingdom of enenkio as an island state, independent of the governments of the marshalls and the united states, may be researched at the official internet site. on behalf of the government of the kingdom of enenkio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the marshall islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish marshallese domination over eneen-kio atoll. we are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to marshallese ancestry and traditions. in lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming new year are extended to all in peace. news article

july 14, 1998: communiquï¿½ï¿½ to correspondents recent articles defaming the government of the kingdom of enenkio have been maliciously published under the guise of a marshall islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". we have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the marshall islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. we urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the kingdom of enenkio which are not validated. to that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. for your advice, the following statement was issued by the state secretary of the kingdom in reply: the kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. no claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. we are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of hm king hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the united states government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. 
the kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the rmi. we are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the united states from the shores of eneen-kio atoll so natural marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. as to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. we say, let the issue be played out in the people's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. while we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'ï¿½ï¿½tre is clearly mandated in the preamble to 
the constitution of enenkio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org 
referencing the news article in the marshall islands journal entitled ""kingdom of enenkio sets up in new zealand,"" of may 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the kingdom's web site. the kingdom of enenkio does not sell passports! if you have evidence to the contrary, our foreign ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. you are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an enenkio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. 
the published statement, ""the group ...claims to represent iroijlaplap murjel hermios and the atolls of the ratak chain..."", is wholly false. i have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our internet site to refute the statement. the kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the ratak atolls surely are. contrary to their libelous statements, the kingdom of enenkio was not ""created"" by robert moore and he is not a ""honolulu-based attorney."" hm king murjel hermios is the acknowledged hereditary iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls and is also first monarch of the kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""enenkio"" [sic] (actually enen-kio or eneen-kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first marshallese name for a marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of bok-ak (taongi) atoll. ""wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered eneen-kio atoll by unknown western society writers.

may 4, 1997: news release 
subject: issuance of gold stamps 
the government of the kingdom of enenkio proudly announces commissioning of its inaugural issue of gold stamps. this announcement, made at the first sunday hawaii stamp, coin and postcard show may 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of gold stamps by the kingdom. stamps are expected to be off the presses by early june 1997. first day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""first day of issue"" by the kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the enenkio philatelic mint mailing list. 
background - the kingdom was established in march 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in september 1994. however, due to u.s. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the kingdom lingers in ""exile"". several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in europe, south america, usa and elsewhere. 
a nation in conflict - the land in question, commonly known as wake island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: wake, wilkes and peale. few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll eneen-kio lived in the marshall islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. by way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. the united states of america began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by congressional apology to hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the monarchy. 
""state of war"" - by way of an official march 1997 declaration sent to top u.s. officials, the kingdom of enenkio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from united states warships. the primary objective of the notice was to request a congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the north pacific ocean by the united states. calls to end u.s. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the united states government. inaugural issue - the gold stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. for that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. however, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. the extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. note: stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. 
closing comments - the government of the kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the kingdom of enenkio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the pacific region. in doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the united states and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. the proceeds from the sale of gold stamps will help fund the restoration of the kingdom and end the conflict in peace.

march 31, 1997: news release 
an official document entitled a declaration, was sent march 22 to top executive and legislative officials in the federal government of the united states, including selected cabinet members. the document asserts that: ""a state of war exists over the kingdom of enenkio atoll by way of acts by the federal government of the united states."" this is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. one of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the north pacific ocean by the united states. 
this latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the kingdom was established in march 1993, each with similar objectives. calls for the u.s. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the king, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the united states. 
the land in question, commonly called wake island, is comprised of three small islands, wake, wilkes and peale, named by ""western explorers"" for western persons. what of the native discoverers? the crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the northern ratak atolls of marshall islands, the united states seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. historical records reveal that the multiple landings by united states warships, en route to the philippines on war missions, and subsequent congressional action, were the sole basis of the u.s. claim. the motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the east. such a station was never established at wake island. it was destined to become a military installation. 
however, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the u.s. president by the german consul in the marshall islands and some measure of correspondence followed. but since the u.s. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and germany was defeated in the first world war, the objections fell into oblivion. it is understood from written accounts of oral marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. the u.s. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the caa (predecessor of the faa) allowed pan american airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. clearly, the so-called annexation by the u.s. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. when the u.s. congress apologized for the overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy in 1993 and the u.s. navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of wake island. the islands of eneen-kio, as the northernmost atoll in the ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the marshall group. while not being used for navy target practice as kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of eneen-kio atoll and the military mission at wake airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the american public. even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by christian missionaries, natives continued to use eneen-kio, authority to go there being issued by the ratak iroijlaplap (paramount chief). king murjel hermios holds that title today. by way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to wake island. the u.s. cannot produce a title. the hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. 
upon the basis of events and actions by the united states, the administration of the kingdom of enenkio, by virtue of the declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a state of war"" exists over the island nation. this is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. sovereignty and independence of the kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. the belief is that truth and law is on the side of the kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of u.s. ""ownership"" and occupation. native north americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. in the declaration, demands are made as follows: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable 
accord for the survivors of the said state of war..."". ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""if unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and war reparations to citizens."" 
ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
every 
action of every kind in or on enenkio atoll or within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone..."" 
ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the department of the interior ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than twenty-seven consecutive months and most recently referenced by a certified invoice, no. 97-us-03, dated march 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ that the ""...congress of the united states is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". 
the government of the kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the kingdom of enenkio atoll as an independent nation under god. it seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the united states and asks them to use their influence accordingly. appeals are being made to the united nations. news article skip to next file ï¿½top of page 
february 6, 1995: news release 
on behalf of his majesty, king murjel hermios, monarch of enenkio atoll, titular head of state, paramount chief (iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago of pacific ocean islands of the marshall islands, i bid you a warm marshallese greeting -- yokwe! the purpose of this notice is twofold: first, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. as long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the united states remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. summary of events 1993-94: two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the pacific ocean, enenkio, formerly known as wake island. the first was issued on february 25, 1994. it followed two announcements: 1) officials of the us air force at hickam afb, hawaii said in articles published new year's eve and day in both honolulu newspapers that the usaf no longer wanted to maintain wake island airfield and wanted to turn it over to interior department or another military organization by 1 february and abandon it by 1 october, 1994; 
2) us army space and strategic defense command of huntsville, alabama issued an environmental impact assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of wake island; part of the ""star wars"" program, i am led to believe. 
an emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of enenkio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. letters to mr. clinton, members of congress, u.s. army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of enenkio (wake i., peale i., wilkes i.), denounced the army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the marshall islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. 
on march 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of enenkio as an independent nation under the authority of his majesty murjel hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to mr. robert moore, appointed minister plenipotentiary. the constitution, succession act and other documents were thereafter drafted. on september 30th, a formal declaration of sovereignty was signed into law by ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the usa founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. it declared the kingdom of enenkio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged his majesty, king murjel hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as head of state and embraced the constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. 
documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the united nations, un security council, nato, south pacific commission and others. letters of personal appeal were sent to un leaders. a special request for protection and assistance was sent to the un security council. on october 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the united states regarding the illegal january 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of eneen-kio atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international human rights law, un charter terms and terms of the compact of free association with the republic of the marshall islands (public law 99-239; january 14, 1986). having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the u.s. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of us$100 million. the second official press release was issued on november 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the marshall islands journal, a weekly newspaper and islands business pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. 
request for media response: 
the thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? how about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? or is it world domination? people of enenkio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 
1. investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by u.s. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of eneen-kio atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (note: these facts and validity of the hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 
2. investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and u.s. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of enenkio . (note: it is my understanding wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of south vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 
3. reflect on the contrasting history of u.s. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 
4. respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of enenkio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 
5. bring to light u.s. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (note: congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of wake island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 
6. fully disclose to the people of the united states u.s. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to eneen-kio atoll by king hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for human rights protected under international law, united nations charter and conventions and the u.s. compact with the marshall islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (note: u.s. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy the prior year and the return of the hawaiian island, kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by enenkio citizens.) 
parting shot: 
what truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the u.s. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. it is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing king hermios have escaped official response from officers of the u.s. federal government. our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked american foreign policy of a century ago. if this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of american attempts at ""fixing up the world"". the title of ownership and inheritance of eneen-kio atoll pre-dates formation of the united states by two centuries or more. it is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. people have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. in conclusion, i reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of u.s. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of god-given individual rights. thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry.

november 21, 1994: news release 
in a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include wake island, site of a u.s. military outpost, his majesty, king murjel hermios, through his legal representative, minister plenipotentiary, robert moore, the u.s. has been given the boot out of wake island. moore served legal notice on top u.s. government officials in october 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. the filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of king hermios) by the gun boat, uss bennington in 1899. 
the legal document, a commercial affidavit, declaration of fair value and demand for payment, was served under recognized principles of common law and international commercial codes. it details the specifics of king hermios' ancestral rights to wake island, the illegality of the u.s. claim and violations of native laws, international agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the hermios property. it also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. 
while putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, u.s. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep king hermios and the citizens of enenkio living in compulsory exile. 
eneen-kio atoll, a name derived from marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including wake. predecessors in interest of king hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to eneen-kio atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years bc. during the colonial invasion of pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. a case in point is in that of the hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the u.s. congress and president bill clinton for the illegal u.s. government overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy. king hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary paramount chief (iroijlaplap) of all the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago of the marshall islands, which terminates to the north, beyond eneen-kio atoll. mr. moore has full authority to act on the king's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted occupation forces in favor of restoring the king's assertion of his native allodial rights. most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the u.s. air force command, 15th logistics group, hickam afb, hawaii. nearly identical articles published in the star bulletin and honolulu advertiser on december 31, 1993 and january 1, 1994 headlined: ""air force willing to give up its hold on wake island"" and stated: ""not much activity there anymore, so the air force wants to give up control"". according to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of king hermios, his predecessors and people. mr. moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of state. the democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its executive council. 
since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, mr. moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the united states, military officers and members of congress. the following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, king murjel hermios: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ formal letters to president clinton and vice-president al gore in february 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. as a military base, wake airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. 
ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ in response to the environmental assessment of the proposed 
theater missile defense rocket launch activities, formal letters of protest sent to the pentagon and u.s. army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from wake island over several years into the waters of the marshall islands, went unanswered. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ letters to members of the u.s. congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ a resolution dated march 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of enenkio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of king murjel hermios. it was likewise ignored. after waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of enenkio and having heard no objection from the united states, mr. moore assembled the ministers of the executive council. they, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to eneen-kio, formally passed and signed the declaration of sovereignty on september 30, 1994. they also accepted the draft of the constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing his majesty, king murjel hermios as head of state and his family as the first royal family of enenkio . while the king and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of eneen-kio atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the emperor of japan, the emperor of germany, and the king of spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of truth, honor and peace. those principals are embodied in the constitutions of enenkio and of the united states. those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the u.s. congress in public law 99-239 (jan. 14, 1986), signed by president ronald reagan as the compact of free association with the marshall islands and federated states of micronesia. the compact acknowledges superiority of all marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land.

microwave station awarded to my late father,mr joseph
francis in 1999 to expatiate companies. in fact, after

1,"it was the spring of 1979.  i was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  each day in the
cafeteria, i walked from table to table ...stealing other kids' lunch money.no, i didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made
them a little deal.  ""let me borrow two dollars today,"" i said,
""and i'll bring you five dollars next week.""  the investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and i couldn't pony up the cash,
i promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and i didn't even get beat up.hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.first of all, greed is your number one enemy. you're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
they are looking out for their own money, not yours.the ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is now.  according to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""never"".  in a sense, they are right.  if you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  but here's the problem:do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich?hell no!you want the money now - so you can enjoy it. it's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  if you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  where would
you travel?  what kind of car would you buy?  the fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.if your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  you want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  you don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was unstable.  that's how you're going to make the 
money.what i'm talking about here is day trading.  my father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30k and down 30k. in the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. the day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of xyz for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  he acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  it's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  the truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  they don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.they make their money only if you believe two lies:1) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) that using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively do not want you to know ...the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  after reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, i've learned the following lessons:** achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** anyone can do it.** it only takes a few hours to learn.when i discovered the secret to day trading, i didn't become
wealthy overnight.  if you want instant cash, drive to wal-mart. 
buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. the 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.after learning the fundamentals of day trading, i started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  the next few months gave me the practical
experience i needed to really earn a living, and i was pulling
close to a six figure income. in less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
i had made my first million.  the knowledge that i gained 
during those formative trading years i am willing to share
with you in my new book, the master trader.  you will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as i teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that i've used profitably
year after year.the income of the day trader can be staggering.  thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  the difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  i will provide that knowledge,
and i will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. average income of a day trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year after reading the master trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win despite the current market weakness. here is just a snippet of what i will teach you:*** make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
*** learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
*** save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.
*** learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 
*** learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 
*** profit on huge intraday price swings.
*** make money on the biggest news stories.
*** actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 
*** learn how to use the tools and information wall street 
professionals use.
*** learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
it's time to ask yourself: ""am i going to listen to the 
professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell?  or am
i going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money right now in the stock market?""who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy wall street stockbroker, or yourself?with the master trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with day trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional

understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. if you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - order today and start paving the road to your
own financial future.oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the california
coast - with cash.  oops, they weren't laughing anymore.in a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  if you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune

",1,1,0
1,"it was the spring of 1979.  i was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  each day in the
cafeteria, i walked from table to table ...stealing other kids' lunch money.no, i didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made
them a little deal.  ""let me borrow two dollars today,"" i said,
""and i'll bring you five dollars next week.""  the investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and i couldn't pony up the cash,
i promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and i didn't even get beat up.hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.first of all, greed is your number one enemy. you're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
they are looking out for their own money, not yours.the ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is now.  according to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""never"".  in a sense, they are right.  if you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  but here's the problem:do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich?hell no!you want the money now - so you can enjoy it. it's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  if you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  where would
you travel?  what kind of car would you buy?  the fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.if your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  you want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  you don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was unstable.  that's how you're going to make the 
money.what i'm talking about here is day trading.  my father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30k and down 30k. in the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. the day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of xyz for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  he acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  it's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  the truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  they don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.they make their money only if you believe two lies:1) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) that using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively do not want you to know ...the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  after reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, i've learned the following lessons:** achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** anyone can do it.** it only takes a few hours to learn.when i discovered the secret to day trading, i didn't become
wealthy overnight.  if you want instant cash, drive to wal-mart. 
buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. the 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.after learning the fundamentals of day trading, i started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  the next few months gave me the practical
experience i needed to really earn a living, and i was pulling
close to a six figure income. in less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
i had made my first million.  the knowledge that i gained 
during those formative trading years i am willing to share
with you in my new book, the master trader.  you will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as i teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that i've used profitably
year after year.the income of the day trader can be staggering.  thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  the difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  i will provide that knowledge,
and i will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. average income of a day trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year after reading the master trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win despite the current market weakness. here is just a snippet of what i will teach you:*** make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
*** learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
*** save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.
*** learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 
*** learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 
*** profit on huge intraday price swings.
*** make money on the biggest news stories.
*** actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 
*** learn how to use the tools and information wall street 
professionals use.
*** learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
it's time to ask yourself: ""am i going to listen to the 
professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell?  or am
i going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money right now in the stock market?""who is looking out for your best economic interests - some

investments in set-top boxes, 
conditional access software and the upgradation of headend
networks - a great

1,"attn:i am edward mulete jr. the son of mr. steve mbeki mulete from zimbabwe. i am sorry this mail
will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother mrs. clara 
got your contact through her private search.
due to the current war against white farmers in
zimbabwe and the support of president robert mugabe to
claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
favor for re-election.all white farmers were asked to
surrender their farms to the government for
re-distribution and infact to his political party
members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
opposition party that did not support the president
idea. he then ordered his party members and the police
under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
down everything in the farm. they killed my
father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
after the death of my father, our local pastor and a
close friend of my father handed us over will
documents with instructions from my father that we
should leave zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. the will 
documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
to the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
easily be found by his enemies. the total amount is
us$21.5m.we are therefore soliciting for
your assistance to help us move the fund out of
zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. the president's present ban of
international press into zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
finance minister to avoid giving white farmers fund transfer
clearance above us$1m is just a few of the
unthinkable things he is committing in my country.
i have tried to reach my father's close friend mr.
john casahans from australia also a farmer who was
leaving in zimbabwe with us but left with his family
late last year following this ugly development to no
avail.
should you be interested to help us, contact me
immediately via email for easy communication and i
will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. we have concluded a wonderful plan of 
caring out the transfer within two weeks. please note that 
this transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
not endanger you or us in any way. we have resolved to give you 20%
of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
forward to coming over to your country to invest our
share and settle there. i will a private
phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.please do not use the reply button, reply only to edmulete7@netscape.net please take note.god bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.mr. edward mulete

individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates. we have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. do not drop your policy as it may be worth cash to you now.why do people sell their policies? 
the reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. some reasons may be to:pay off debts

eliminate costly premiums

grants money - guaranteed! ""each day over one million dollars in free
government
grantsâ  is given away to people just like you for a wide
variety of business and personal needs
â â â â â â â 
dear grant seeker,
in a moment, i'll tell you
exactly how & where to get grants. this money has to
be given away, why not to you?
you may be thinking, ""how
can i get some of this free grants money""
maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?
let me tell you it's not
impossible! it's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
united states are receiving millions of dollars from these government and
private foundation's everyday.
who can apply?
anyone can apply
for a grant from 18 years old and up!
grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! grants don't have to be paid back,
ever! claim
your slice of the free american pie.
this money is not a loan,
trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
these government agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.
you decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the government
agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
this money is non taxable & interest free.
none of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and u.s. citizen are entitled to this money.
there are currently over
1,400 federal programs, 24,000 state programs, 30,000 private foundations
and 20,000 scholarship programs available.
this year over $30 billion
dollars in free personal and business government grants money will be given
away by government grants agencies.
â government personal
and business grants facts:
over 20 million people get government
money every year:
1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money
to start or expand a business
4,000,000 people get money to invest
in real estate
6,000,000 people get money to go
to college
10,000,000 people get free help and
training for a better job

into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where free business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the federal
government.
it
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the united
states of america wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in free
consulting and research grants.
with an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
in
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
most
people never apply for free business grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.the fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive free grants money and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.government grants

low income families, repair your home, rent, mortgage payments, utility
bills, purchase a new car, groceries, childcare, fuel, general living expenses,

the online content business.dear friends,the online content business is doing fantastic.
sound crazy? perhaps.  with 
advertising, online and off,  taking it on the chin
for the past two years,  online content sites have been shutting down,  laying
off staff and pulling back on their offerings.
however,  this horrible environment
has resulted in an undeniable trend:  content businesses are challenging
people to pay for content.  finally,  after five years of free,  people are beginning to understand that online,  as in the real
world,  you get what you pay for and they are taking out their credit cards.
 u.s.  consumers spent $675 millionâ on paidâ online content last
year,  a 92 percent increase over 2000 spending levels,  according to online
publishers association,  and that figure is expected to increase exponentially
this year.  look at these success stories:
new york times digital has 
been steadily increasing its paid content services over the last year,  and 
registered a 16 percent increase in its total revenues for the latest quarter.
thestreet.com brought over 
$3 million in subscriptions last quarter,  an increase of almost 50 percent 
over the year-ago quarter.
consumerreports.com will 
reach over a million paying subscribers by the end of this year.
realnetworks' consumer multi-media 
subscription service has more than 750,000 subscribers,  bringing in $17.8 
million in the last quarter.
the wall street journal online
added over 6,000 new paying customers last quarter,  bringing its subscriber
base to 646,000.
ft.com has signed up 17,000 
subscribers in three months since it launched its premium site in may.
in recognition of this trend we're hosting 
the third installation of our innovative content management summit on october 10, 
2002.  the event charts the changes in the content industry from free 
to paid subscription services,  and the technologies that are enabling the management and monetizing of content.
our previous content management 
summit (aka digital rights summit) on october 18 last year in new york city 
and january 29 in los angeles were unqualified successes.
the content management summit 
iii,  taking place in new york at the millennium broadway on october 10, 
2002,  will bring together the 100 executives from the leading content and 
distribution firms for a focused day of networking and discovering practical 
solutions.
the event will feature presentations 
from software and services companies providing services
and solutions for selling,  distributing,  managing,  and protecting content.
we're thrilled that 
microsoft,  teleknowledge,  emeta,  and liquify will all be demonstrating 
their latest products and services.
the event will also feature six intimate round tables focusing on various aspects of online content.
 these panels are meant to provide an informal forum to discuss the challenges
facing these specific vertical markets,  the changes in the sectors since
the dot-com downfall,  and best practices in the industry.  the panels will
feature leading practitioners in each sector,  and will also include an interactive
question and answer session with the audience.
among the round table topics will be:
weblogs:  how they are affecting big media 
companies,  editorially as well as in content delivery/production mechanisms.
financial news and information 
companies:  how they are using technologies to deliver content to users, 
and how the economics have changed since the stock market downfall.
business information services 
such as hoovers,  lexis-nexis and others:  best practices in the industry, 
 niche product launches and revenue streams.
daily news/newspaper companies 
publishing online:  how speed dictates technology choices,  and the move towards
paid content and its implications,  among other issues.
consumer and entertainment 
publishers:  how do publishers determine the value of entertainment content, 
 the push towards paid subscriptions,  online advertising and other issues.
join us on october 10th 
for this very important event.  if you are directly responsible 
for content management at a major content site you may qualify for 
a vip ticket.  please e-mail your request with your name,  title and bio to
invite@cmsummit.com.  if you are
with a software or services provider,  or anyone not directly responsible 
for the purchase of content management software or solutions,  you can purchase 
a ticket to this event for $1,200 at invite@cmsummit.com.

1," ilug , from;mr.michael kamah and family,
          johannesburg,south africa.my dear ,good day.this very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.but it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and i quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.i got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.my name is mr.michael kamah, the second son of mr.smith  kamah, of beitbridge zimbabwe.at the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,mr.robert g.mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.my father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .he publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by mr.robert mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.that not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !
confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.i therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the republic of south africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.during my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of eight million and six hundred thousand united states dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a finance and security company in the republic of togo for a cash and carry diamond and gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.in view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,i therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of africa finally,to the europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present mugabe's!
 regime.my mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.now this is what i actually want you to do for me;1. i want you to be presented to the finance and security company as the person i contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the republic of togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. to finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. please,i hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.and also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,i emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.best regards, mr.michael kamah and family.

comprised primarily of african americans who represent the 
impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""black america;"" 
confused?! i shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. if you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!"" .and of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! did you know 
that many young african american women refuse to date african 
american males if they do not own or possess an automobile. in 
fact many young black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
""thugs"" or ""street hustlers;"" also, did you know that many young 
african american males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    ""attention"" this is not another ""boyz in the hood"" story!
 
these newly distinguished ""black generation xers"" are suffering 
through utter chaos. ""baby makers, loser choosers, welfare 
abusers...images of my america"" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young african 
american male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in ""black america,"" and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. it is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
""mainstream american society."" a society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young african american men, and women currently suffer from. the 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
the author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. the negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. these poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young ""black america"" 
today. to learn more about this dynamic self contained society

       socijalisticka partija srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa milomirem minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke slobodana milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je socijalisticka partija srbije, pa zvao se on i slobodan milosevic''.
       socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici slobodana milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu slobodana milosevica u hagu, od politickog zivota u srbiji, pripisujuci milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje s. milosevica, ,,sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste socijalisticku partiju srbije.
        iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. branislav ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova sps, danas rukovodstvo sps koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije slobodan milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija rukovodstvo i glavni odbor te stranke.
        medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da bata zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, slobodanu milosevicu.
        po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika slobodana milosevica.
        mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se sps svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori dejana stjepanovica i igora raicevica, i po neki milinka isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika sps. 
        obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         branko ruzic i dejan backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela slobodana milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista beograda, ana djurovic udala za branka ruzica, predsednika mladih socijalista srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo dejna backovia, svog potpredsednika. backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova io go sps-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz saveta mladih. sve u svemu, mladi u sps se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u sad.
          sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im bata prodje losije od seselja koga je predsednik slobodan milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?_______________________________________________________________________

(and of course you get your full commission.) i'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am i affiliated with any real estate firm, which means i can work with you just about any way you want. please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. sometimes i can even pay retail price. the only guarantee i'll make is that i will not waste your time, and in most cases i can tell you over the phone whether i'm interested or not. if you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  synteligent properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com best wishes,

democratic republic of congo. 
tel no: your country intl. access code +8821652098236
email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com
dear sir/madam
seeking your immediate assistance. please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. this
is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a 
dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. this request may seem strange
and unsolicited but i crave your indulgence 
and pray that you view it seriously. my name is col. michael bundu of the
democratic republic of congo and one of 
the close aides to the former president of the democratic republic of
congo laurent kabila of blessed memory, may 
his soul rest in peace. due to the military campaign of laurent kabila to force out the rebels in
my country, i and some of my colleagues were 
instructed by late president kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
ammunition worth of twenty million, five hundred 
thousand united states dollars only (us$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. we were then given this money privately 
by the then president, laurent kabila, without the knowledge of other
cabinet members. but when president kabila 
was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
were schedule to travel out of congo, we 
immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
in congo for safe keeping. the security of the 
said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
seizure of properties of col. rasheidi karesava 
(one of the aides to laurent kabila) a tribesman, and some other military
personnel from our same tribe, by the new 
president of the democratic republic of congo, the son of late president
laurent kabila, joseph kabila. in view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country 
as the beneficiary. 
we have sufficient ''contacts'' here to move the fund under diplomatic
cover to a security company in europe in your 
name. this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked
''confidential'' and it 
will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. our inability to move this money out of congo all this while stems from
our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 
(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
with the late president kabila, immediately 
after his son took office. though we have neither seen nor met each other,
the information we gathered from an associate 
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
your sincere assistance, this transaction will 
be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
weeks. the said money is a state fund and 
therefore requires a total confidentiality. we would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
fund in europe. this is because we are under 
restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
order not to lose this fund which we have worked 
so hard for. thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
of congo, you can contact me through my email 
addresses, tel/fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.please note that there are no risks involved in this deal as everyone's
security is guaranteed if we follow the required 
guidelines. i will hence furnish you with further details of this deal as
soon as i am assured of your sincere interest to assist 
us. i must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily 
confidential, whatever your decision, while i await your prompt response.
thank you and god bless. 
best regards 
col. michael bundu(rtd). m_bundu@rediffmail.comn\b. when you are calling my line, you dial your country intl. access
code, then you dial directly, do not include my country 
code i.e. (243). just dial your country intl. access code + 88216
52098236. you can also contact me through the above 
email addresses.--

ikoyi-lagos.attn:,                  first, i must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of itâ’s nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the nigeria chamber of commerce and industries.we are top officials from the federal ministry of works and housing,(fmw&h), federal ministry of finance and the presidency, making up the contract review panel(crp) set up by the federal government of nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. in the course of our work on the crp, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the fmw&h during the last administration.the companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of us$21.4 million floating in the escrow account of the central bank of nigeria ready for payment.i have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of us21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.this is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.we have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)all logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.these information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the central bank of nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. yours faithfully,egnr. femi daniel.nb:bank account details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque. --

1,"helloyou may have seen this business before and
ignored it. i know i did - many times! however,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
i was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!with easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. and the
earnings potential is truly staggering!i'll make you a promise. read this e-mail to the end! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a recession is coming or not, who is
president, or whether you keep your current job or not.
yes, i know what you are thinking. i never responded
to one of these before either. one day though,
something just said: ""you throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. what the heck.""
believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, i thank every day that i had that feeling. i cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be
doing had i not. read on. it's true. every word of it.
it is legal. i checked. simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.as seen on national tv:making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.thanks to the computer age and the internet!
==================================================
be an internet millionaire like others within a year!!!before you say ""bull"", please read the following.
this is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. the show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".due to the recent increase of popularity & respect
this program has attained, it is currently working
better than ever.this is what one had to say: ""thanks to this
profitable opportunity. i was approached many times
before but each time i passed on it. i am so glad
i finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
to my astonishment, i received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey.
==================================================
another said: ""this program has been around for a
long time but i never believed in it. but one day
when i received this again in the mail i decided
to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. first month i only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that i made
a total of $290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, i have made over
$710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and not change anything.""more testimonials later but first, =========== print this now for your future reference ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$if you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...then read it again and again!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$follow the simple instruction below and 
your financial dreams will come true, guaranteed!instructions:=====order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the
report you are ordering and your e-mail address to the
person whose name appears on that list next to the report.
make sure your return address is on  your envelope top
left corner in case of any mail problems.===when you place your order, make sure ===
===you order each of the 5 reports! ===
you will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
your total cost $5 x 5 = $25.00.within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.important - do not alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will not work!!! people have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. but it does
not work this way. believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. so do not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
because if you do, it will not work for you.
remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! this is a legitimate business. you are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. treat it
as such and you will be very profitable in a short
period of time.1.. after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and remove the name & address of the
person in report # 5. this person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5.3.. move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4.4.. move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3.5.. move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 26.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.please make sure you copy every name & address
accurately! this is critical to your success.==================================================
**** take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
do not make any other changes.save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. to assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. there are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally
==================================================let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. with a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. that's 100 people who
responded and ordered report # 2.those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. the 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for report # 3.those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. the 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for report # 4.those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
report # 5.that's 100,000 orders times $5 each = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... grand total=$555,550.00numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and
figure out the worst possible responses and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still
make a lot of money!
==================================================remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people
ordering out of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?there are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!method # 2: by placing free ads on the internet
==================================================advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of free places to advertise.
placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. we strongly suggest
you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you
go along. for every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it.
always provide same day service on all orders.this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.===========available reports ====================
the reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". it is simply about time.
time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. concealing it is simply so no one
can see there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.order each report by its number & name only.
notes: always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for
each report. checks not accepted. make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. on one of those sheets of
paper, write the number & the name of the report
you are ordering, your e-mail address and your
name and postal address.place your order for these reports now :

$$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== if you do not receive at least 10 orders for
report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.=== after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
report # 2. if you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.** once you have received 100 or more orders for
report # 2, you can relax, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! this is important to remember: every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.you can keep track of your progress by watching which
report people are ordering from you. if you want to
generate more income send another batch of e-mails
and start the whole process again. there is no limit
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
following is a note from the originator of this program: 
you have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
no risk and just a little bit of effort. you can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. follow the program
exactly as instructed. do not change it in any way.
it works exceedingly well as it is now.remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. one of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. so my friend,
i have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.it is up to you now !=============more testimonials===============
""my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in
chicago. i am an accountant with a major u.s.
corporation and i make pretty good money. when i
received this program i grumbled to jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. i made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. i 'knew' it wouldn't work.
jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. i made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'i told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. well, the laugh was on me! within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
i was shocked. i have joined jody in her 'hobby'.""mitchell wolf m.d., chicago, illinois
================================================
""not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
but conservative as i am, i decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. i was surprised when i found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
i made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. the nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. there simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""dan sondstrom, alberta, canada
=================================================
""i had received this program before. i deleted it,
but later i wondered if i should have given it a try.
of course, i had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... i did not delete this one!
i made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""susan de suza, new york, n.y.
=================================================
""it really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. i followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. my first month i made $20,
in the 2nd month i made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
life is beautiful, thanx to internet.""fred dellaca, westport, new zealand

1,"hi,i'm a college dropout.  i work about two hours a day.  
i'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and i make over 
$250,000 a year.  are you curious yet?in a minute i'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the internet ...you've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.well, grasshopper, think again ...it's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  yep, people like you and me!ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with no investment and very little 
work.  how?  by learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called bulk email.if you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  i bet you can't click on 
delete fast enough for most of those ads, right?
you might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the internet.  i 
guarantee it.  now let's go back to math 101 and 
review some numbers ...if you sell on ebay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  how many people see your ad?  maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  using bulk email, you can
send your ad to more than a million people a day
at virtually no cost.  whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
zero!stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  if you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  it's that simple ...all you have to do is convince one person out of a
thousand to buy your stuff and you're filthy rich.the best thing is that anyone can do it.  doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in new 
york city.  anyone, and i repeat anyone, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  all 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the internet.i quit college when i was 19 to capitalize on the 
""dot com"" mania, and i've never looked back.  i 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  i saw an 
opportunity and i seized it.  a few years later, 
i bought my own home - with cash.  you don't need any money.  you don't need a product.
you don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  if you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  it would be a dream come true.
so what are you waiting for?!i'm going to ask you four simple questions.  if you answer
yes to all of them, then i can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.here goes ...do you have basic experience with the web? 
do you have a computer and an internet connection?
do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  if you answer yes to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!all you need is ambition and commitment.  this
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  you have to work
to make big bucks, but anyone - and i mean anyone - can do

1,"================this is definitely the answer we all have been waiting for===============every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. when you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why i'm writing you today. although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, i would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any mlm (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit multi-level marketing. with a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. 
the truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, i'm just going to make you a very simple offer. email me with 'send link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and i will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. you can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. this isn't a trick, i'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that i don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. with an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. if you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the internet), that likes to ""look before you leap"" then here is your chance. thank you for your time, and i hope you discover why we're all smiling!!
please do not treat this message as spam. i am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. i was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. i have not used this means of marketing before and frankly i am dubious about its validity. however, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it i'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. if you want more information i will happily supply the link without any obligation. but if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. as this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. thank you.

grants money - guaranteed! ""each day over one million dollars in free
government

variety of business and personal needs
â â â â â â â 
dear grant seeker,
in a moment, i'll tell you
exactly how & where to get grants. this money has to
be given away, why not to you?
you may be thinking, ""how
can i get some of this free grants money""
maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?
let me tell you it's not
impossible! it's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
united states are receiving millions of dollars from these government and
private foundation's everyday.
who can apply?
anyone can apply
for a grant from 18 years old and up!
grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! grants don't have to be paid back,
ever! claim
your slice of the free american pie.
this money is not a loan,
trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
these government agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.
you decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the government
agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
this money is non taxable & interest free.
none of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and u.s. citizen are entitled to this money.
there are currently over
1,400 federal programs, 24,000 state programs, 30,000 private foundations
and 20,000 scholarship programs available.
this year over $30 billion
dollars in free personal and business government grants money will be given
away by government grants agencies.
â government personal
and business grants facts:
over 20 million people get government

into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where free business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the federal

it
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the united
states of america wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in free
consulting and research grants.
with an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
in
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
most
people never apply for free business grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.the fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive free grants money and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.government grants

1,"helloyou may have seen this business before and
ignored it. i know i did - many times! however,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
i was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!with easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. and the
earnings potential is truly staggering!i'll make you a promise. read this e-mail to the end! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a recession is coming or not, who is
president, or whether you keep your current job or not.
yes, i know what you are thinking. i never responded
to one of these before either. one day though,
something just said: ""you throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. what the heck.""
believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, i thank every day that i had that feeling. i cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be
doing had i not. read on. it's true. every word of it.
it is legal. i checked. simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.as seen on national tv:making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.thanks to the computer age and the internet!
==================================================
be an internet millionaire like others within a year!!!before you say ""bull"", please read the following.
this is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. the show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".due to the recent increase of popularity & respect
this program has attained, it is currently working
better than ever.this is what one had to say: ""thanks to this
profitable opportunity. i was approached many times
before but each time i passed on it. i am so glad
i finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
to my astonishment, i received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey.
==================================================
another said: ""this program has been around for a
long time but i never believed in it. but one day
when i received this again in the mail i decided
to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. first month i only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that i made
a total of $290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, i have made over
$710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and not change anything.""more testimonials later but first, =========== print this now for your future reference ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$if you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...then read it again and again!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$follow the simple instruction below and 
your financial dreams will come true, guaranteed!instructions:=====order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the
report you are ordering and your e-mail address to the
person whose name appears on that list next to the report.
make sure your return address is on  your envelope top
left corner in case of any mail problems.===when you place your order, make sure ===
===you order each of the 5 reports! ===
you will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
your total cost $5 x 5 = $25.00.within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.important - do not alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will not work!!! people have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. but it does
not work this way. believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. so do not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
because if you do, it will not work for you.
remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! this is a legitimate business. you are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. treat it
as such and you will be very profitable in a short
period of time.1.. after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and remove the name & address of the
person in report # 5. this person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5.3.. move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4.4.. move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3.5.. move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 26.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.please make sure you copy every name & address
accurately! this is critical to your success.==================================================
**** take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
do not make any other changes.save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. to assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. there are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally
==================================================let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. with a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. that's 100 people who
responded and ordered report # 2.those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. the 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for report # 3.those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. the 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for report # 4.those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
report # 5.that's 100,000 orders times $5 each = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... grand total=$555,550.00numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and
figure out the worst possible responses and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still
make a lot of money!
==================================================remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people
ordering out of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?there are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!method # 2: by placing free ads on the internet
==================================================advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of free places to advertise.
placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. we strongly suggest
you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you
go along. for every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it.
always provide same day service on all orders.this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.===========available reports ====================
the reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". it is simply about time.
time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. concealing it is simply so no one
can see there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.order each report by its number & name only.
notes: always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for
each report. checks not accepted. make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. on one of those sheets of
paper, write the number & the name of the report
you are ordering, your e-mail address and your
name and postal address.place your order for these reports now :

$$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== if you do not receive at least 10 orders for
report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.=== after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
report # 2. if you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.** once you have received 100 or more orders for
report # 2, you can relax, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! this is important to remember: every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.you can keep track of your progress by watching which
report people are ordering from you. if you want to
generate more income send another batch of e-mails
and start the whole process again. there is no limit
to the income you can generate from this business !!!

it works exceedingly well as it is now.remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. one of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. so my friend,
i have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.it is up to you now !=============more testimonials===============
""my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in
chicago. i am an accountant with a major u.s.
corporation and i make pretty good money. when i
received this program i grumbled to jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. i made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. i 'knew' it wouldn't work.
jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. i made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'i told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. well, the laugh was on me! within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
i was shocked. i have joined jody in her 'hobby'.""mitchell wolf m.d., chicago, illinois
================================================
""not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
but conservative as i am, i decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. i was surprised when i found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
i made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. the nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. there simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""dan sondstrom, alberta, canada

it luckily came again...... i did not delete this one!
i made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""susan de suza, new york, n.y.

easy money with little cost to you. i followed the

1,"helloyou may have seen this business before and
ignored it. i know i did - many times! however,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
i was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!with easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. and the
earnings potential is truly staggering!i'll make you a promise. read this e-mail to the end! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a recession is coming or not, who is
president, or whether you keep your current job or not.
yes, i know what you are thinking. i never responded
to one of these before either. one day though,
something just said: ""you throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. what the heck.""
believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, i thank every day that i had that feeling. i cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be
doing had i not. read on. it's true. every word of it.
it is legal. i checked. simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.as seen on national tv:making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.thanks to the computer age and the internet!
==================================================
be an internet millionaire like others within a year!!!before you say ""bull"", please read the following.
this is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. the show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".due to the recent increase of popularity & respect
this program has attained, it is currently working
better than ever.this is what one had to say: ""thanks to this
profitable opportunity. i was approached many times
before but each time i passed on it. i am so glad
i finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
to my astonishment, i received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey.
==================================================
another said: ""this program has been around for a
long time but i never believed in it. but one day
when i received this again in the mail i decided
to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. first month i only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that i made
a total of $290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, i have made over
$710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and not change anything.""more testimonials later but first, =========== print this now for your future reference ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$if you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...then read it again and again!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$follow the simple instruction below and 
your financial dreams will come true, guaranteed!instructions:=====order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the
report you are ordering and your e-mail address to the
person whose name appears on that list next to the report.
make sure your return address is on  your envelope top
left corner in case of any mail problems.===when you place your order, make sure ===
===you order each of the 5 reports! ===
you will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
your total cost $5 x 5 = $25.00.within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.important - do not alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will not work!!! people have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. but it does
not work this way. believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. so do not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
because if you do, it will not work for you.
remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! this is a legitimate business. you are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. treat it
as such and you will be very profitable in a short
period of time.1.. after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and remove the name & address of the
person in report # 5. this person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5.3.. move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4.4.. move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3.5.. move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 26.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.please make sure you copy every name & address
accurately! this is critical to your success.==================================================
**** take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
do not make any other changes.save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. to assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. there are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally
==================================================let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. with a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. that's 100 people who
responded and ordered report # 2.those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. the 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for report # 3.those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. the 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for report # 4.those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
report # 5.that's 100,000 orders times $5 each = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... grand total=$555,550.00numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and
figure out the worst possible responses and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still
make a lot of money!
==================================================remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people
ordering out of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?there are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!method # 2: by placing free ads on the internet
==================================================advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of free places to advertise.
placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. we strongly suggest
you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you
go along. for every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it.
always provide same day service on all orders.this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.===========available reports ====================
the reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". it is simply about time.
time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. concealing it is simply so no one
can see there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.order each report by its number & name only.
notes: always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for

whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.well, grasshopper, think again ...it's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  yep, people like you and me!ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with no investment and very little 
work.  how?  by learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called bulk email.if you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  i bet you can't click on 
delete fast enough for most of those ads, right?
you might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the internet.  i 
guarantee it.  now let's go back to math 101 and 
review some numbers ...if you sell on ebay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  how many people see your ad?  maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  using bulk email, you can
send your ad to more than a million people a day
at virtually no cost.  whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
zero!stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  if you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  it's that simple ...all you have to do is convince one person out of a
thousand to buy your stuff and you're filthy rich.the best thing is that anyone can do it.  doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in new 
york city.  anyone, and i repeat anyone, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  all 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the internet.i quit college when i was 19 to capitalize on the 
""dot com"" mania, and i've never looked back.  i 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  i saw an 
opportunity and i seized it.  a few years later, 
i bought my own home - with cash.  you don't need any money.  you don't need a product.
you don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  if you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  it would be a dream come true.
so what are you waiting for?!i'm going to ask you four simple questions.  if you answer
yes to all of them, then i can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.here goes ...do you have basic experience with the web? 
do you have a computer and an internet connection?
do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  if you answer yes to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!all you need is ambition and commitment.  this
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  you have to work
to make big bucks, but anyone - and i mean anyone - can do 
it.you're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
don't worry, it's not! i will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  you'll be generating 
orders - and making money - in less than seven days.okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?no problem!!  i'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like craaaaaazy! most people delay
starting an internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but i'm removing that hurdle right now.  
after reading the bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  there is no excuse 
not to get started! i will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. in fact ...i personally guarantee that you will start your own

to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!i will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""seven days to 
bulk email success"".  this seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  on day one, for 
example, i teach you where to find a product to sell. 
the next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  on the seventh day, you just click send!  your 
very first campaign is ready to go.as a special bonus, you'll recieve a free copy 
of our stealth mass mailer, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! i'll even

on the internet, bulk email is your only option.

1,"hi -( http://club.4tfox.com )you get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
most of these emails are from people who are not making any money.
and they expect you to listen to them?enough.if you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually doing it.  we are making
a large, continuing income every month.  what's more - we will
show you how to do the same thing.this business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  if you can send
an email, you can do this.  no special ""skills"" are required.how much are we making?  anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
we are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
but keep in mind, we do work at it - i am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  that kind of job does not exist.  but if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.this is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done for you - it is all based on your effort.  but, as i said,
there are no special skills required.  and this income is residual -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).interested?  i invite you to find out more.  you can get in as a

most of these emails are from people who are not making any money.
and they expect you to listen to them?enough.if you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually doing it.  we are making
a large, continuing income every month.  what's more - we will
show you how to do the same thing.this business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  if you can send
an email, you can do this.  no special ""skills"" are required.how much are we making?  anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
we are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
but keep in mind, we do work at it - i am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  that kind of job does not exist.  but if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.this is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done for you - it is all based on your effort.  but, as i said,
there are no special skills required.  and this income is residual -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).interested?  i invite you to find out more.  you can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  we are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.to grab a free id# and have more information, simply go to the

 standard trust bank ltd,
 lagos,nigeria.
 dear sir,
 i am mr.vincent nnaji, bank manager of standard trust bank,lagos,nigeria. i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
on january 6,1998 a foreign oil consultant foreign contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation mr. james herbert made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us$20m ( twenty million united states dollars) in my branch.
upon maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr. james herbert died from an automobile accident. 
on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr.james herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. this sum of us$20m has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. no one will ever come forward to claim it. 
according to nigerian law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund. consequently my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money i deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as i tagged them to be photographic materials for export i am writing you because i as a public servant i cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.
 i want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. all these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
this is simple. i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. the money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 
there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. if you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 
upon your response i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 
thanks and regards,
 mr.vincent nnaji.",0,0,0
1,"dear sir, 
with due respect and humility i write you this letter which i believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and i.
i got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. i am a native of konobo in the
kerema
local district of sierra leone in west africa and the wife of late dr.
mundi a.
kojo who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to major john paul
koromah
because he was the director general national gold and diamond mining
corporation
of sierra leone. few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (ibrahim and amina) to move out of sierra leone immediately,
before the powerful economic community of west african states (ecomog)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. my children
and i
managed to escape to togo through the help of my husband's friend. we came
into
togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25million(twenty five
million
united states dollars only) in two trunks boxes which i have deposited
with a
trust company here in togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
meanwhile, i want to leave togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. i want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
trust
company in any of their branches in europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. you should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
we have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. but due to how i
am being
monitored by the sierra leonean government secret agents, i will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (ibrahim kojo). please contact my son on this
email:
ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
same into
your account.
your private fax and phone is needed in this transaction for private
discussions. 
note: there is no risk involved in this business. 
remain blessed,

â "" qualify for at least $25,000 in free
grants money - guaranteed! ""each day over one million dollars in free
government
grantsâ  is given away to people just like you for a wide
variety of business and personal needs
â â â â â â â 
dear grant seeker,
in a moment, i'll tell you
exactly how & where to get grants. this money has to
be given away, why not to you?
you may be thinking, ""how
can i get some of this free grants money""
maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?
let me tell you it's not
impossible! it's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
united states are receiving millions of dollars from these government and
private foundation's everyday.
who can apply?
anyone can apply
for a grant from 18 years old and up!
grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! grants don't have to be paid back,
ever! claim
your slice of the free american pie.
this money is not a loan,
trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
these government agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.
you decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the government
agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
this money is non taxable & interest free.
none of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and u.s. citizen are entitled to this money.
there are currently over
1,400 federal programs, 24,000 state programs, 30,000 private foundations
and 20,000 scholarship programs available.
this year over $30 billion
dollars in free personal and business government grants money will be given
away by government grants agencies.
â government personal
and business grants facts:
over 20 million people get government
money every year:
1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money
to start or expand a business
4,000,000 people get money to invest
in real estate
6,000,000 people get money to go
to college
10,000,000 people get free help and
training for a better job
getting business
grants
anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where free business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the federal
government.
it
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the united
states of america wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in free
consulting and research grants.
with an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
in
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
most
people never apply for free business grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.the fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive free grants money and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.government grants

low income families, repair your home, rent, mortgage payments, utility
bills, purchase a new car, groceries, childcare, fuel, general living expenses,

in tuition to become a nurse or $35,000 to open up the day-care center,
you've always dreamed of owning. and then, go out and apply for a grant
to buy a home for you and your family. and once your new business starts
doing well you could go out and get another grant for expansion of your
business. the possibilities are endless.

a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie
(me and you) i am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence i am about
to establish with you. i have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.well, i am  victor sankoh, son to mr.foday
sankoh
who was arrested by the ecomog peace keeping force
months ago in my country sierra leone.
few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a deposit agreement and
cash receipt he made with a security company in
abidjan cote d'ivoire where he deposited one iron box
containing usd$ 22 million dollars cash (twenty two
million dollars).this money was made from the sell of gold and diamond
by my father and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.thereafter, i rushed down to abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. also, i have been granted political stay as a
refugee by the government of cï¿½te d'ivoire.meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from cï¿½te d'ivoire immediately for investment .
based on this , i solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your account, but i will
demand for the following requirement:(1) could you provide for me a safe bank account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another neaarby country where taxation will not
takegreat toll on the money?(2) could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
theinvestment of this money?(3) could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
willbe invested?please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence i will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. i am a
christian and i will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust i have established
on you.for your assistance in this transaction, i have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount at the end of this business. the security

**shangrila zowie wowie (tm)**
********************************""personal choice"" primo exotic supplemental smoking botanical / gnarly ""sweetgrass"" variety / supplemental agenda ""seventh heaven"" paradoxical configuration for the ""significant"" enhancement and pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- potentiated; gnarly, whole-plant matrix  -- paragonic reserve; enigmatic blendage mood ""sensitive / responsive"" smoking / brewing herba.actions & indications: simultaneous, high-spirited; ""stimulation / relaxation / aphrodisia"" (significant paradise consequence!)this is the personal choice, sensitive, responsive smoking (""smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! this is the product and the value that you have been searching for. this is the product that you will buy again & again!we have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""sensitivity / responsiveness"" & aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. and indeed, we have. many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. even our own two signature ""smokables"" (ragga dagga & stoney mahoney) are being discontinued. that shangrila zowie wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. this ""shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. first, on an agricultural level, fields for our gnarly sweetgrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. this is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. but, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of shangrila zowie wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! as well, most potentiating factors of shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. however, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of zowie wowie. we are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of shangrila zowie wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.suffice to say, without any hype or glype, shangrila zowie wowie gnarly sweetgrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! hard to believe that this product is absolutely legal!* mill-stoned & honed.
* depressive regressive!
* psychologically uplifting!
* good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!

* easy ignition, smooth draw, sweet, heady taste.
* easy on, easy off!
* satisfaction guaranteed!
* no ""munchie"" factor.
* no failed drug tests!shangrila zowie wowie (tm) gnarly ""sweetgrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""smoka"", via an herb-pipe. as is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. for the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (steep approximately one teaspoon of shangrila zowie wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) when smoking shangrila zowie wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""sensitive / responsive"" smoke. both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. smoke and brew concurrently is absolutely a sweet, sensitive treat!shangrila zowie wowie (tm) ""sensitive/responsive"" smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, mill-stoned & honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: half-edged lily-rare bian lian (lobeline factors), kona lactuca virosa, yucatan turnera aphrodisaca, hawaiian vervain (maui strain), siberian leonorus sibricus, rare lotus leaf, jamaican blue verbena officinalis, spanish peumus crocus sativa, chinese (flowering-tops only) horny goat weed, ginko biloba, african cola vera, and african wilde dagga (flowering-tops only). shangrila zowie wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. shangrila zowie wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.shangrila zowie wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. in addition, although no factor in shangrila zowie wowie (tm) is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of exotic botanical resources that shangrila zowie wowie (tm) not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  all things in their time.... ********************************************************

ally or only briefly. it is for this reason, although prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: radix salviae, sensitive mimosa bark, arillus euphoriae, shizandra, frutcus mori, caulis polygoni, zizyohus, tang kuei, cedar seed, sweetflag rhizome, cuscutae, amber, radix scutellariae, evodia, longan, arisaema, cistanches, radix polygalae, red sage root and eucommia. no factor contained within prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. all botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. suggested usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. best taken on an empty stomach. (during times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) also note: prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.********************************************************

from:mr. desmond stevens                     urgent assistance. 
you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. i am mr.desmond stevens, the first son of dr. dennis stevens, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe. i was furnished with viable information from the world trade centre here in amsterdam, the netherlands and decided to write you. 
before the death of my father, he had taken me to amsterdam to deposit the sum of ten million,five hundred thousand united states dollars (us$10,500,000) in a security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe. this money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company. this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farm in swaziland. this land problem came when zimbabwe president mr. robert mugabe, introduced a new land act that wholly affected rich white farmers and some few black farmers. this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society. infact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act of which my father was one of the victims. it is against this background that my family and i who are currently staying in amsterdam decided to transfer my fatherï¿½s money to 
 a foreign account. since the law of the netherlands prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any account or to be involved in any financial transaction. 
as the eldest son of my father, i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands for the fear of going through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history. moreover, the netherlands foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment from asylum seekers. as a businessman, whom i have entrusted my future and my family in his hands, i must let you know that this transaction is risk free. if you accept to assist me and my family, all i need you to do for me is to make arrangement and come to amsterdam, the netherlands so that you can open the non-resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas. this money i intend to use for investment. i have
  options to offer you, first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for the transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country. whichever option you choose, feel free to notify me. i have mapped out 5% of this money for all expenses incurred in processing this transaction. if you do not prefer a partnership, i am willing to give you 25% of the money while the remaining 70% that is meant for me, will be for the investment in your country. 
please, contact me with the above telephone and e-mail address, while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction. 
yours faithfully, 
desmond stevens. --

 judgment courses offers an extensive audio training
course in 
 ""how to collect money judgments""
  .          s6 if you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
money judgment is and 
 why processing money judgments
can earn you very substantial income
  .if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a money judgment against them.you are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""its now up to you to collect on the
judgment"". the court does not require the loser to pay you.
the court will not even help you. you must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. the result is that millions of
judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""in 79% of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a
dime.""the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. right now in the united states there is
between 
 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected money
judgment debt
  . for every judgment that is paid, 5 more
judgments take its place.we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued judicial judgments since. we invented this
business. we have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.with our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing money judgments.by following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of money judgments.the income potential is substantial in this profession. 
 we
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year 
 . some choose to operate out of
their home and work by themselves. others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in money judgments that we are currently
processing. of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
joint ventures are where we make our money. we only break
even when our course is purchased. we make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. the norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments.
annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. this is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time
  .one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. if you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. the judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. the judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.the way we train you is non-confrontational. you use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. you
never confront the debtor. the debtor doesn't know who you
are. you are not a collection agency.simply stated the steps to successful money processing
are as follows:mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with money judgments. (we train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. they call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.you send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. this applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. we offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. they range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
the prices of our reports are very low. typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. for example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)when you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original judgment holder.once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of
judgment to the court. (included in the course)quote's from several of our students:thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""i just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. 
 my
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars
  . your
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened
doors for me in the future. there's no stopping me now.
recently thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of
judgments he is working on.after only having this course for four months, larry s. in
area code 314 stated to us: "" 
 i am now making $2,000.00 per
week 
 and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the
next year. i am having a ball. i have over $250,000 in
judgments i am collecting on now.""after having our course for 7 months larry s. in 314 stated
"" 
 i am now making $12,000.00
  per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments i am collecting on. looks like i
will have to hire someone to help out""marshal in area code 407 states to us ""i feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. i
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">from the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:with our course you can own your own successful business.
a business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. a business which is
extremely interesting to be in. a business in which every
day is new and exciting.none of your days will be hum-drum. your brain is
challenged. a business, which protects you from corporate
downsizing. a business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. a business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. a business, which lets you
control your own destiny. our training has made this happen
for many others already. make it happen for you!if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.
 please call us at 1_406_652_0194 
 .we have 
 customer support staff available to you from 8:00am to
9:00pm (mountain time) 7 days a week
  . if you call this number
you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel.
they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. when you call our customer support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. if you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the customer support person
can work with you to place your order. we are very low key. we
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.thank you for your time and interest.

dear friend,this last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in 
minnesota. â the water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the 
breeze rustled their limbs. â we had such a great time renewing old 
friendships, seeing how everyone's children had grown, and catching up on 
everyone's lives. â the last day we had a family picture taken, thinking 
that we'd all send them out as our christmas cards.in october we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. 
everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but i could not 
find myself in the picture. â i looked and looked and finally got out a 
magnifying glass. â to my horror, i found this dark curly headed woman 
with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! â dear god it was me!!! 
â my body resembled an inflated hot air balloon that would take off should 
a heavy wind arise... it was hideous! â i had mirrors in my house but most of them were 
designed to only reflect â from the waist up and i honestly hadn't noticed 
that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a 
shapeless clump of flesh. â i was always so happy that i didn't have a lot 
of wrinkles, â but i didn't realize that i wasn't wrinkled because my skin 
was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.well, this situation was not  acceptable. â but i was at a loss as to what to do. 
â my willpower, well, basically sucks and i had so-o-o much weight to lose 
that i wasn't sure i'd live long enough to get it all off. â plus, i hate 
diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before i fall 
off the food wagon. â my goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless.and then 
it happened. â i received a brochure about a product called 
berry trim 
plus. â it seemed to contain everything i needed. â 
it curbs your appetite, increases energy, burns fat at the fastest rate 
possible, no special diets are required, you don't have to exercise like a 
lunatic, it doesn't make you feel speeded, â and it 's all natural with no 
adverse side effects. â it also was priced well below other products so 
i figured that if it didn't work i wouldn't be out much money. â it is 
guaranteed, but i'm always too lazy to bother to send back the empty bottles 
so this diet supplement seemed perfect for me.it's been about 6 weeks now but i swear i'm beginning to look like that 
famous cindy person that models. â my cheekbones are absolutely glorious.. 
i swear i look like a new person and a good one at that. â berry trim 
plus  also keeps your skin tight so you don't look like a 
shar pei with nasty folds of skin hanging all around after you lose the weight.
i promise you that this product works. â it does everything it promises 
and then some. â just losing the weight alone, makes you feel so much 
better and younger. â it puts zest back into your life and assures you 
that you'll achieve your weight loss goals. â in another few weeks i will 
reach my goal...something i had given up on. â also, hlna  offers an affiliate 
program so you might as well make a few bucks while losing those pounds.

oprah, nightline, maria shriver, 48 hours, 20/20, 
playboy, kiplingers and more have all interviewed this 
famous private investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  take a moment and learn his long sought after secrets.this pi is the originator of seeking out judicial judgments and using 
them to make a fortune!  most people have no idea what a 
judicial judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.hereï¿½s the scoop-  when one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a judicial judgment.
but, even though they won- guess what? they soon find out these 
shocking facts:a) its now up to them to collect on the judgment
b) the court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) the court will not help you to collect it. 
d) employees of the court are forbidden by law from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. all the winner really has is a worthless piece of paper. they 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. and the winner 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  all of a sudden that 
big cash settlement the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  what happens then?- millions of judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  right now in the 
united states there are between 200 and 300 billion dollars of 
uncollected judicial judgments. for every judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid judgments take its place. so how does this private investigator make a fortune collecting 
other peopleï¿½s judgments?  thatï¿½s what we want to tell you.  
through long and hard work, this sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a fortune without the high collection cost.the income potential is substantial in this profession! using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in judicial judgments!  and, 
new judgments become available every day.  the work is
always there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
this is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to start 
something ï¿½on the sideï¿½ that will offer a solid income in the future. 
it is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. make no mistake though-this is not 
a get rich quick scheme. it requires effort on your part.  
the more effort the bigger the reward.  you choose how much you 
want to make!if you've ever dreamed the american dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youï¿½ve been looking for.  
this business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
it might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. this business lets you control your destiny! you donï¿½t need 
to be a rocket scientist either! our training has made this happen for 
many others already. make it happen for you too!take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained 
counselors by calling 1-720-733-7315.  let them answer your 
questions so that youï¿½ll know if itï¿½s right for you.  there is no cost 
or obligation on your part except the cost of a phone call.  join a small number of people who are reaping the big 
rewards, by calling us at 1-720-733-7315 today!",0,0,1

there's way too much loading on this page. i don'tlikethe wav file loading and though i didn't here anything windows promptedmefor a mp3 decoder, so i presume one of those was loading as well. someofthe links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also textbasedor smaller gifs and put on the index page. for a minute i didn't knowwhereto go.~~~~thiswas a neat site.ï¿½ the site was original and i could tell that mrs.t certainlyseemsto enjoy working on her site.ï¿½ the graphics were pretty, or funny,dependingon each one, but well arranged. but, the text on the home pagewasgoing from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlappedtheleft rose border. i'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.ï¿½also, i thinkusinga sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though i did likehowthefont color matched the flowers. btw, i was viewing the site with internetexplorer.idon't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage,it's overkill. i also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactiveopinions, and a site on graphics. relating the name of your site tothesite content helps when new visitors visit.onyour home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.ifyou do so, try starting with a logo for your site. i realize you are showingdifferentpictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepictureon each page so it's easy to tell i'm still visiting the same website.onyourarticles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseofthe background colors. maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehindthat would work better.lookfor a host that doesn't use pop-ups - i would have checked out morepagesbut i hated getting those pop-ups each time i clicked to a new page.iwent to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is mucheasiertodeal with than the pop-ups. i'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~thisis an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not allof whichivisited - and it has something for every member of the family, however,mostofit is for either mothers or the kids. she even has some games to play -goodforsmaller kids, too!

dear friends & future millionaire: as seen on national tv: 
making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for 
an investment of only $25 u.s. dollars expense one time 
thank's to the computer age and the internet ! ================================================== be a millionaire like others within a year!!! before you say ''bull'', please read the following. this is the letter you 
have been hearing about on the news lately. due to the popularity of 
this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted 
an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see 
if it really can make people money. the show also investigated whether or 
not the program was legal. their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely no laws 
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the 
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. due to the recent increase of 
popularity & respect this program has attained, 
it is currently working better than ever. this is what one had to say: ''thanks to this profitable opportunity. i 
was approached many times before but each time i passed on it. i am 
so gladi finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. to my astonishment, i received total $ 
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" 
pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey. =================================================== here is another testimonial: ""this program has been around for a long 
time but i never believed in it. but one day when i received this again 
in the mail i decided to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the simple 
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. 
first month i only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that i made 
a total of $290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, i have made over $710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change 
anything.'' more testimonials later but first, ===== print this now for your futurereference ====== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
if you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and 
comfortably, please read the following...then read it again and again!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ follow the simple instruction below and your financial 
dreams will come true, guaranteed! instructions: =====order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the report 
you are ordering and your e-mail address to the person whose 
name appears on that list next to the report. make sure your return 
address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail 
problems. === when you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. 
you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. your total cost $5 x 5=$25.00. within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from 
these 5 different individuals. save them on your computer so they will be 
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in 
case something happen to your computer. important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next 
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is 
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority 
of your profits. once you understand the way this works, you will also see 
how it does not work if you change it. remember, this method has been 
tested, and if you alter, it will not work !!! people have tried to put their 
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. but 
it does not work this way. believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then 
nothing happened. so do not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed. because if you do, it will not work for you.
 
remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and 
remove the name & address of the person in report # 5. this person 
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 
2.... move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5. 
3.... move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4. 
4.... move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3. 
5.... move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 
6.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position. please make 
sure you copy every name & address accurately! ========================================================== **** take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. do not make any other changes. 
save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. to assist you with 
marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide 
you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk 
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. 
there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going: 
method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally ==========================================================
 
let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will 
assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. let's 
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. also many people 
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). 
continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. with a 0.2% 
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. those 10 people responded 
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. out of those 50,000 
e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. that's=100 people responded and 
ordered report # 2
. 
those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. 
the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3. those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails 
sent out. the 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for report # 4.
 
those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 
(50 million) e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for report 
# 5
 that's 100,000 orders times $5 each=$500,000.00 (half million).
 
your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 
... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ grand total=$555,550.00 numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and figureout 
the worst possible responses and no matter how you 
calculate it, you will still make a lot of money !
 
========================================================= remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people 
ordering out of 5,000 you mailed to. 
dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even 
one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? there are 
over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting. believe me, 
many people will do just that, and more! 
method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet ======================================================= advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds 
of free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the internet will 
easily get a larger response. we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 
and dd method # 2 as you go along. for every $5 you receive, all you 
must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it. always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and 
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they 
receivethe report. =========== available reports ==================== order each report by its number & name only. notes: 
always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not 
accepted. make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets 
of paper. on one of those sheets of paper, write the number & the name 
of the report you are ordering, your e-mail address and your name 
and postal address. place your order for these reports now : ==================================================== report # 1: ""the insider's guide to advertising for free on the net""

$$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2 
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
=== after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2. if you did not, 
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
=== once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2, you 
can relax, because the system is already working for you, and the 
cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember: 
every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front 
of a different report. 
you can keep track of your progress by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. if you want to generate more 
income send another batch of e-mails and start 
the whole process again. 
there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business !!! ====================================================== following is a note from the originator of this 
program: you have just received information that can give you 
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with no risk and just 
a little bit of effort. you can make more money in the next 
few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. follow the program 
exactly as instructed. do not change it in any way. it works 
exceedingly well as it is now. 
remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 
as instructed above. one of the people you send this to may send out 
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. 
remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers 
you will reach. 
so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information, materials and 
opportunity to become financially independent. it is up to you now ! ============ more testimonials ================ ""my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in chicago. i am an 
accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make pretty good money. 
when i received this program i grumbled to jodyaboutreceiving ''junk 
mail''. i made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. i ''knew'' it wouldn't work. jody totally ignored 
my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. i 
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''i told you so'' on 
her when the thing didn't work. well, the laugh was on me! within 3 weeks 
she had received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she had received 
total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! i was shocked. i have joined jody 
in her ''hobby''. 
mitchell wolf m.d., chicago, illinois ====================================================== ''not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. but conservative that i am, i decided that 
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' i was 
surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with 
orders. i made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. the nice thing about 
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. there simply isn't a 
better investment with a faster return and so big."" 
dan sondstrom, alberta, canada ======================================================= ''i had received this program before. i deleted it, but later i wondered 
if i should have given it a try. of course, i had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed again by someone 
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... i did not 
delete this one! i made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the 
money came within 22 weeks."" 
susan de suza, new york, n.y. ======================================================= ''it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. i followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. my first month i made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was 
$362,840.00. life is beautiful, thanx to internet."".

 here is a sample of just a few of the letters we receive every week 
thanking us for what our product has done:  ""i am astounded! the day before i started taking the gh1, 
i took blood tests. then i began using the gh1 as directed. 
after 8 weeks i took blood tests again. 
my igf-1 level (evidence of gh) showed a 70% increase! 
furthermore, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144! 
i definitely feel better overall and certainly have more energy. 
to say the least i am very impressed and pleased with gh1. 
my ""biological"" age is now that of a 40 year old!"" 
-dr. a. zuckerman m.d., age 60, ny ""a year ago, my blood pressure was 180/120 and i was on blood 
pressure medication. i also started the anti-aging formula, gh1. 
after a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80-- 
and i haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!"" 
-susanne peters, laguna beach, ca ""after 2 weeks on anti-aging formula gh1, i noticed a higher 
level of energy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision 
were enhanced. my blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and 
it seems every other day i have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill 
at the gym. i've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and 
a change in my lungs with much easier breathing. after 4 months, 
i only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. one morning, i had to do an extra 
karate workout just to expend all the extra energy!"" ""after 6 months on 
gh1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down to 65! also, my stamina has 
increased, as well as my energy and sex drive--this product is great!"" 
-dr. richard boyd, 78 years old, harvard clinical psychologist, ca ""as a straight-ahead bicycle racer, i used to have to wait a minute 
and a half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where 
i could sprint again. after a month on gh1, i can now sprint again 
after only 45 seconds! gh1 cut my waiting time in half!"" 
-ed caz, age 40, fresno,ca ""when i heard gh1 would reduce body fat increase lean muscle without exercise, i couldn't believe it--but in just a few months i lost 4 inches around my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--even though i gained 10 pounds! also, after 4 months, my fine vision returned. i no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print."" 
-larry baker, age 54,oceanside, ca ""i have been taking anti-aging formula gh1 for five months now. 
i have been under great stress in my business. 
i believe that taking anti-aging formula gh1 has had a big part in keeping 
my energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst 
of discouraging circumstances. last week i came down with a cold. 
colds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. i am progressing through those stages but more quickly than before. hallelujah! my eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. 
my muscles seem to have better tone-i notice it in my legs-and i have more energy 
when i go out walking."" 
- carolyn munn ""i was taking injections of gh for over one year. a friend suggested that 
i try anti-aging formula gh1, since i was spending 1,000 us dollars a month and needed 
a doctor to inject it daily. in 2-3 weeks i felt better from the anti-aging 
formula gh1 than the whole time i was getting the injections. 
thank you anti-aging formula for greatly helping to improve my life!"" 
-rita mills mccoy ""i have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time i was tested, 
in my twenties. i was on anti-aging formula ghi for only 1 month when my levels 
dropped from 245 to 210. i could hardly believe it! after 3 months on anti-aging 
formula gh1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its normal 
coloring. i have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. all of this 
without having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taking 
few sprays of anti-aging formula gh1 a day. wow! 
-alan ross, 43 years old gh1 is the highest concentration of orally administered gh1 
available on the market today. injections of gh taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. the individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. gh1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of gh.  
 what is growth hormone (gh)? growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which 
is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the 
endocrine system. gh is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically 
similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few 
hours of sleep and after exercise. gh is one of the most abundant hormones 
secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout 
the body. production of gh peaks at adolescence. every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. 
the body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously 
dying and regenerating. the brain and the nervous system retain their original 
cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to 
store memories of every new experience. overall intelligence and the ability 
to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. 
when growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the 
all-natural potential for great benefit. growth hormone is an amazing substance 
which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the 
proper dosage amounts. gh is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, 
melatonin and dhea, that all decline in production as we age. hormones are tiny 
chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate 
the activities of the vital organs. the word ""hormone"" is derived from a greek word 
meaning to stimulate. many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the 
effects of aging; however, gh reaches far beyond the scope of these other 
hormones. not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly 
reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including 
making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. gh also 
helps restore hair color and hair loss. 
 
the eternal fountain of youth? our bodies naturally produce gh in abundance when we are young, and its production 
gradually slows over time. the amount of gh after the age of 21 falls about 14% per 
decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. while gh is not new, 
its availability as a supplement has been limited. specialized clinics and physicians 
have been using gh for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. 
unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with gh, only the medical 
profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. another problem has been 
that the large gh molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only 
effective administered through injections. however, a new technology developed by 
anti-aging inc., now makes gh an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. 
 
gh production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61  
growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. 
the amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. 
this results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age 
of 60. humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, 
200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. between the ages 
of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in sds, 
or somatotrophin deficiency syndrome. these symptoms are part of the disease called 
aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. 
healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. 
those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include 
an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen.
 after numerous clinical studies, the following was determined 
after 6 or more months of gh therapy:  _ improved memory 
_ regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and other organs 
_ increased sexual drive and performance 
_ increased fertility 
_ enhanced immune system 
_ quicker wound and fracture healing 
_ new hair growth and color reparation 
_ sharper vision 
_ improved exercise performance and tolerance 
_ increased muscle mass without exercise 
_ reduction of cellulite and fat 
_ increased stamina and vitality 
_ reduction in high blood pressure 
_ improvement in sleep 
_ anti-aging 
_ wrinkle reduction and smoothing 
_ decrease in ldl (bad) cholesterol 
_ increase in hdl (good) cholesterol 
_ strengthening of bones 
  is gh safe? 
 
gh has been successfully used in the medical community 
for over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years. 
edmond klein, m.d. and l. cas terry ph.d., tested over 
800 individuals and reported in their 1995 study that 
gh had substantial benefits and no side effects.

subject: using pictures as links i'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. 
but, someone told me i should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
pictures. to me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  how can i get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
without coming right out and saying so? for example, i have a page with 
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my

using a proxy, but i don't know what that means. i am wondering is 
there a way to get access to these sites? -- a proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. 
i have had very good results with surfola. basically you surf to their servers and then 
from there you surf through/from their servers. i have several places i surf from that 
block content. surfola easily bypasses them! its also free! you can also make money 
with them but i just use them to bypass anal retentive isp/corporate providers and 
because they allow me to surf anonymously! i have a detailed right-up on them at  http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/surfola.php

also note, that if your isp is dictating to you which sites you may or

~~~~i reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
i don't like mustard yellow for a background. also in the second or third 
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as 
shown on the page.i feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
on the site. i will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  as has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
doing the page is always good.  we need some information about 
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. 
~~~~dennis - i took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
for improving your page.
1- i use internet explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
'smaller'. the text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
for all the text. by making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
you were screaming at me. also, the background was just too much.
2- there were spelling errors in the text. often it might be difficult for you 
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
look it over. spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.
3- offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
before they subscribe. also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
their email address, you must have a privacy policy and let them know 
they can unsubscribe.
4- think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
it looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.
5- offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
newsletter contains. maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.
6- build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
page. remove all pricing information from the home page.
~~~~i feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
i also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
i noticed some spelling errors, and i think that a link to the classifieds 
site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
a site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!
~~~~this is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
message.  i did not like the background colour, however that is 
personal, it did not detract from the information.  i was tempted 
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
a current issue. there was an error in the wording (a word 
missed) which needs correction and i think the fonts could be 
smaller. overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*~~~~could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
are errors in the following paragraphs : 
""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, 
send your to my email""
~~~~a single page site. it is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
a way to get people to visit. i wouldn't, for example. he claims to 
have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
subscribe. as it is, i would not bother.
~~~~what does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? some useful 
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
advertisement on the net. but what we get here is a newsletter 
with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
he also tells of paid category of advertisements. this is all we get 
from a site which has a grand title. even the information about 
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
points size which gets difficult to read. 
~~~~a neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes. there is only really one problem with this page - its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter. no, scratch that, its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. a bold enough 
move perhaps but i learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so i didn't even subscribe. presumably 
you'd want to get people to sign up so might i suggest splitting 
the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click

questions: from: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com 
subject: using pictures as links i'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. 
but, someone told me i should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
pictures. to me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  how can i get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
without coming right out and saying so? for example, i have a page with 
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. mark

subject: access using a proxy >from: cj  (cj5000@post.com) 
>subject: unblocking sites so i can access? (issue #422) --> i am currently living in a place where the isp is 
blocking 50% of 
the web. i was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by 
using a proxy, but i don't know what that means. i am wondering is 
there a way to get access to these sites? -- a proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. 
i have had very good results with surfola. basically you surf to their servers and then 
from there you surf through/from their servers. i have several places i surf from that 
block content. surfola easily bypasses them! its also free! you can also make money 
with them but i just use them to bypass anal retentive isp/corporate providers and 
because they allow me to surf anonymously! i have a detailed right-up on them at  http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/surfola.php

>subject: unblocking sites so i can access? (issue #422) cj, two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: 
http://www.anonymise.com and

32 easy ways to breath new life into any webpage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=â â â â â  it's true.
ask the ceos of yahoo.com and america online.â  they'll
tell you it's true.â  send an email to terry dean or allen
says or jim daniels and ask them about it.â  they'll agree
100% that it's true.â  don't just take my word for it.
in fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
it's true. anyone can earn a living online.â  really, they
can.â  but, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
â â â â  one of those necessities is a website.
â â â â  now, your website does one of two things...
â â â â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
for 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
and there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
poor sales letters.
does your website convince people to make a purchase?
if not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.â  doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.â  write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.â  why?
because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.â  keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) use an illustration to get your point across.â  in my
sales letters i have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. i have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across montana on a grizzly bear.â  leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. people love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.â  tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.â  emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""â  it effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.â  your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.â  go back to the beginning of this article.â  the first
words were, ""it's true.""â  i can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""what's true?""
immediately, your mind wanted to know what i was talking
about.â  before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.â  carefully craft your first
line.â  if you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) use bullets. people spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. in fact, they often reread them over and over. use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) launch into a bullet list immediately.â  shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.â  hit them with your best shot.
pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.â  by offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.â  after all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) just let it all flow out.â  write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. you
can edit it later.â  if you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.â  write it all down.â  then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.â  edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) make your sales letter personal.â  make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""i"" and ""my.""
your ad copy must be written about your customer not
yourself.â  i'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""i don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, i just care about my lawn.""â  leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.â  when you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""i,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.â  it's a free service.â  make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) write like you speak.â  forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.â  write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""and"" or ""because.""
don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
write like you speak. your sales letter isn't the great
american novel, so don't write it like you are ernest
hemingway.
9) use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.â  use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. don't be
afraid to use short sentences.â  like this one.
or this.
see what i mean?â  shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)â  stress the benefits, not the features.â  again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""what's in it
forâ  me?""â  what need is it going to meet? what want is it
going to fill?â  how is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?â  spell it out.â  don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
for example:â  if you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? i don't care about your selection. but, i
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.â  so, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. you're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) keep the reader interested.â  some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how i can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. they are
filled with words and phrases that i need a dictionary to
understand.â  unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) target your sales letter.â  when you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.â  for example: if you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.â  then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.â  write another
letter targeting senior citizens.â  still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.â  the possibilities are endless.
all you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""college students, work only
5 hours a week.""â  your sales letter is now targeted. upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.â  you could advertise the ""college students"" page
in a campus ezine.â  the ""senior citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
by creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.â  and, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) make your ad copy easy to follow.â  use short sentences
and paragraphs. break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. one
thing that i have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
â â â â  ...is to use a pause like this.
start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? click
here to continue.""
14) use similes and metaphors for effect.â  when the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make noah start building another ark.""
if they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""â  use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.â  when you think of superman, what
comes to mind?â  immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""â  ""more powerful than a locomotive.""
""able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" see how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) focus on one product or service.â  don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. it only
confuses the reader.â  keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.â  then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) make it stand out.â  don't kid yourself.â  there are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.â  how will you stand out among the
crowd?â  your sales letter must inject personality. it must
breathe of originality.â  your product or service is
different. it's not like all of the rest.â  it is unique.
right? your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.â  it must create a feeling of ""you won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) be believable. ""earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
delete.â  good grief, do they think i am an idiot or
something?â  get real.â  don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.â  you'll ruin your reputation.
let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.â  once you have been branded a liar, you will
never be anything but a liar.â  it doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.â  be believable.
don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) be specific. don't generalize your information, but
rather be exact.â  instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" by generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.â  ""what am i really getting here?â  does he even know?""
when you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""this person must have counted.â  i know exactly what
i can expect.""â  ""platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote claude
hopkins in his classic book ""scientific advertising."" ""they
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) be complete. tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.â  answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.â  think about it from their point of view.
ask yourself, ""why wouldn't i buy this?""â  then, address that
in your sales letter.â  remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) use testimonials to boost your sales.â  share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.â  satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.â  ""if these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then i
probably will too.""â  especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
a headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.â  use them frequently -but don't overuse.â  a well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. you will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.â  they are
that important.
22) avoid asking stupid questions.â  ""wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""doesn't that sound great?"" ""would
you like to be as successful as i am?""â  avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
if the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.â  by offering a free
item, you canâ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.â  by doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
and, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.â  one of the things
that i have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that out-value the actual product
i am offering.â  ginsu made this one famous. they were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) use connective phrases like ""but wait, there's more""
and ""but that's not all.""â  these phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.â  again, the idea is more and more
value and benefits to the reader.
26) always include a deadline.â  by including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""if i don't order within 24 hours, then i won't get the
bonuses.""â  ""oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
i've got to hurry.""â  let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. deadlines
are very effective.â  every sales letter should have one.
27) tell them exactly how to order.â  be clear as to the
order process. point them towards the order link.â  tell
them what methods you offer. (i.e. credit cards, checks,
etc.)â  make this process as simple and clear as can be.
if it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)â  explain when the product will be delivered.â  how
quickly will the order be processed?â  when will the order be
available?â  let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.â  the more specific you
can be here, the better.â  let them know that you have a
system in place.â  ""operators are standing by.""â  their order
will be handled properly.â  tell them.
29) offer a money back guarantee.â  take away their last
reason to hold back.â  offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.â  most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.â  you are required to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.â  since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service risk-free.
30) instruct them to respond immediately.â  many people
just need to read those words, ""act now!""â  ""order today!""
""click here to instantly place your order.""â  you've got them
this far, now tell them what you want them to do.â  get them
to ""act fast!""â  have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
way?
31) include a post script.â  people will always read the
p.s.â  always. in fact, the p.s. is one of the most important
parts of your sales letter. why?â  because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.â  a
p.s. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. use
your p.s. to restate your offer in detail.
32) include a second post script.â  you better believe
if they read the first p.s., they will read a p.p.s.â  use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.â  i guarantee you they will read it.
use these 32 tips and i guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.â  in fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

 32 easy ways to breath new life into any webpageâ â â â â â â  it's true.
ask the ceos of yahoo.com and america online.â  they'll
tell you it's true.â  send an email to terry dean or allen
says or jim daniels and ask them about it.â  they'll agree
100% that it's true.â  don't just take my word for it.
in fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
it's true. anyone can earn a living online.â  really, they
can.â  but, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
â â â â  one of those necessities is a website.
â â â â  now, your website does one of two things...
â â â â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
for 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
and there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
poor sales letters.
does your website convince people to make a purchase?
if not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.â  doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.â  write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.â  why?
because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.â  keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) use an illustration to get your point across.â  in my
sales letters i have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. i have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across montana on a grizzly bear.â  leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. people love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.â  tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.â  emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""â  it effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.â  your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.â  go back to the beginning of this article.â  the first
words were, ""it's true.""â  i can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""what's true?""
immediately, your mind wanted to know what i was talking
about.â  before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.â  carefully craft your first
line.â  if you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) use bullets. people spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. in fact, they often reread them over and over. use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) launch into a bullet list immediately.â  shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.â  hit them with your best shot.
pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.â  by offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.â  after all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) just let it all flow out.â  write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. you
can edit it later.â  if you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.â  write it all down.â  then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.â  edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) make your sales letter personal.â  make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""i"" and ""my.""
your ad copy must be written about your customer not
yourself.â  i'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""i don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, i just care about my lawn.""â  leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.â  when you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""i,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.â  it's a free service.â  make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) write like you speak.â  forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.â  write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""and"" or ""because.""
don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
write like you speak. your sales letter isn't the great
american novel, so don't write it like you are ernest
hemingway.
9) use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.â  use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. don't be
afraid to use short sentences.â  like this one.
or this.
see what i mean?â  shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)â  stress the benefits, not the features.â  again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""what's in it
forâ  me?""â  what need is it going to meet? what want is it
going to fill?â  how is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?â  spell it out.â  don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
for example:â  if you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? i don't care about your selection. but, i
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.â  so, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. you're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) keep the reader interested.â  some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how i can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. they are
filled with words and phrases that i need a dictionary to
understand.â  unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) target your sales letter.â  when you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.â  for example: if you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.â  then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.â  write another
letter targeting senior citizens.â  still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.â  the possibilities are endless.
all you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""college students, work only
5 hours a week.""â  your sales letter is now targeted. upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.â  you could advertise the ""college students"" page
in a campus ezine.â  the ""senior citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
by creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.â  and, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) make your ad copy easy to follow.â  use short sentences
and paragraphs. break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. one
thing that i have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
â â â â  ...is to use a pause like this.
start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? click
here to continue.""
14) use similes and metaphors for effect.â  when the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make noah start building another ark.""
if they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""â  use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.â  when you think of superman, what
comes to mind?â  immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""â  ""more powerful than a locomotive.""
""able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" see how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) focus on one product or service.â  don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. it only
confuses the reader.â  keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.â  then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) make it stand out.â  don't kid yourself.â  there are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.â  how will you stand out among the
crowd?â  your sales letter must inject personality. it must
breathe of originality.â  your product or service is
different. it's not like all of the rest.â  it is unique.
right? your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.â  it must create a feeling of ""you won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) be believable. ""earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
delete.â  good grief, do they think i am an idiot or
something?â  get real.â  don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.â  you'll ruin your reputation.
let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.â  once you have been branded a liar, you will
never be anything but a liar.â  it doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.â  be believable.
don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) be specific. don't generalize your information, but
rather be exact.â  instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" by generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.â  ""what am i really getting here?â  does he even know?""
when you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""this person must have counted.â  i know exactly what
i can expect.""â  ""platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote claude
hopkins in his classic book ""scientific advertising."" ""they
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) be complete. tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.â  answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.â  think about it from their point of view.
ask yourself, ""why wouldn't i buy this?""â  then, address that
in your sales letter.â  remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) use testimonials to boost your sales.â  share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.â  satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.â  ""if these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then i
probably will too.""â  especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
a headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.â  use them frequently -but don't overuse.â  a well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. you will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.â  they are
that important.
22) avoid asking stupid questions.â  ""wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""doesn't that sound great?"" ""would
you like to be as successful as i am?""â  avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
if the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.â  by offering a free
item, you canâ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.â  by doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
and, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.â  one of the things
that i have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that out-value the actual product
i am offering.â  ginsu made this one famous. they were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) use connective phrases like ""but wait, there's more""
and ""but that's not all.""â  these phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.â  again, the idea is more and more
value and benefits to the reader.
26) always include a deadline.â  by including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""if i don't order within 24 hours, then i won't get the
bonuses.""â  ""oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
i've got to hurry.""â  let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. deadlines
are very effective.â  every sales letter should have one.
27) tell them exactly how to order.â  be clear as to the
order process. point them towards the order link.â  tell
them what methods you offer. (i.e. credit cards, checks,
etc.)â  make this process as simple and clear as can be.
if it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)â  explain when the product will be delivered.â  how
quickly will the order be processed?â  when will the order be
available?â  let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.â  the more specific you
can be here, the better.â  let them know that you have a
system in place.â  ""operators are standing by.""â  their order
will be handled properly.â  tell them.
29) offer a money back guarantee.â  take away their last
reason to hold back.â  offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.â  most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.â  you are required to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.â  since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service risk-free.
30) instruct them to respond immediately.â  many people
just need to read those words, ""act now!""â  ""order today!""
""click here to instantly place your order.""â  you've got them
this far, now tell them what you want them to do.â  get them
to ""act fast!""â  have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
way?
31) include a post script.â  people will always read the
p.s.â  always. in fact, the p.s. is one of the most important
parts of your sales letter. why?â  because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.â  a
p.s. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. use
your p.s. to restate your offer in detail.
32) include a second post script.â  you better believe
if they read the first p.s., they will read a p.p.s.â  use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.â  i guarantee you they will read it.
use these 32 tips and i guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.â  in fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

home-mailers needed!
  
$300-$1000 plus weeklysimple, pleasant work...you do at home.
  
  
dear friend,
  
are you seeking a rewarding second income? would you like to set your
own work schedule? work the hours you choose? earn extra income for
your family? if so, then we may have the answer. current statistics show
that by the year 2010, 40-60% of the american work-force will be working
from home. get a jump on your future and secure a job through us. our
company provides a service to thousands of people and businesses across
the united states. with your help, we can reach and provide a better
service to more of these people and businesses, faster and at a lower cost
than our competitors. we handle a marketing program called the
home-mailers program, which consists of envelope processing and mailing.
these positions require no special skills or experience, just a sincere desire
to get started, and earn money!
  
  you can earn good money!!!
  
   potential incomes range from $300 to $1000 weekly or more. pay rate is
based on a $2.00 per envelope basis. the average home-mailer
stuffs anywhere from 150 to 500 envelopes a week, depending on the
amount of free time they have available. the envelopes you process will
make you a substantial income. you'll find this work, done easily and
quickly, can double or even triple your income. with just one or two hours
per day you will be excitedly surprised at how easy we've made it and how
profitable this work actually is. you can earn enough money working in
your spare time to purchase that new car or boat you've been wanting,
pay off credit cards, bills, or even take a vacation. maybe just add more
financial security for yourself or your family. whatever the reason, you can't
go wrong.
  
  all business can be done right from your own home
  
  you can start the same day you receive our materials and begin receiving
money within a matter of days. these positions require no prior experience
or special skills. under contract you will receive everything you need to
get you up and running as fast as possible. paychecks are mailed out every
two weeks on the 1st and 16th of the month.
  
  help solve your money problems
  
   if you are looking for an excellent extra income to relieve financial
pressures, you owe it to yourself to investigate this program. naturally, no
company can afford to send out costly materials to everyone who writes in
asking for it. therefore, we must ask each applicant for a one time
application processing fee of $27.00. this fee covers processing and
materials you will receive upon your acceptance and is returned to you
with your first paycheck. it also assures us that you are serious about
working with our company as a home-mailer. we will not ask or require
you to pay us for any additional information, instructions, or materials to
stay with us, and stay with us as long as you desire. if for any reason you
are not accepted into the home-mailers program, your processing fee will
be sent directly back to you. there is no hassle. however, you must act
promptly. at this time we are in need of dependable home-mailers in your
area, of whom may start in the very near future. there are only a limited
number of positions needed for each region of the country and as soon as
we have enough people to complete the mailing needs in your area we
will not be offering any more applications. we need your help now! so if
you're a productive, positive person we're looking forward to working with
you.
  
  simple, easy, and profitable, this program is the best
  way to make an excellent income at home.
  
  if this sounds like something you might be interested in, read on. if not,
thank you for your time. we hope to hear from you soon.
  
  
sincerely yours,ron m. jenkins

  because we are a company recruiting people from the public we must
assure you that we are the best company to work with and that we provide
the most profitable income. because we require an initial fee to get
started, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.
this fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time
it takes us to get you started. it also assures us that you are serious about
working with the home-mailers program. we know that current home-
mailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their
testimonials. this makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue
our success together. here are just a couple of the many testimonials
received from home-mailers:
  
  i want to thank you for giving me this opportunity
  to work for your company. it couldn't have come along
  at a better time. the work is so simple and the pay is
  incredible. my wife and i have been stuffing envelopes
  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us
  make at our full-time jobs. thanks again!
     j. thomas ------ miami, fl
  
  thank you for everything! i was having trouble
  making ends meet at my present employment. but
  thanks to you and your home-mailers program, i was
  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the
  bank. now i'm looking forward to taking a well
  deserved vacation.

why do we need home-mailers? the cost of supplying an office is more
expensive than most people may think. the cost of office space per square
foot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +
taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,
multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants
and more taxes. we need your services to save time and money!
your role in our company is as an independent commission mailer, not an
employee. we will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer
medical or dental insurance. as a home-mailer, your residence and many
other aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business
expenses. receive cash-back on your taxes! you may request copies of
personal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. all business can 
be done by mail, from your own home. you can start the same day you
receive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a
steady income as long as you desire. these positions require no prior
experience or special skills. there are many distribution companies who

expenses. it is much easier to have independent home-mailers earn 
money doing this work themselves. this program is designed to help 
people cash in with a company who needs home-mailers. the home-mailers
program has been perfected so that it has become one of the most 
successful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the
world with excellent primary and secondary incomes. we invite you to take
part in our success. the money you earn is up to you. we do not require 
that you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. you can take on
whatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop
whenever you want, there are no obligations. there is no need to do any
door to door selling or phone soliciting. you may work in the comfort of your
own home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. no need to leave
your present job. form workshops with your friends or get the whole family 
to join in. the possibilities are unlimited!
  
  due to company expansion
  your services are needed now.

internet success through simplicity
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=every day of the week, i get questions from people all  
 over the world, including my no bs gimg members,  
 wanting to know some of the most valuable ""secrets"" 
 to my on-going internet success.
 
let me say, above all else, i don't believe there are any 
 *true* ""secrets"" to success on the net. what you do to 
 become successful in the online world is not a ""secret"", 
 in my opinion. most successful people follow simple, clear, 
 repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the 
 net or off.
 
but, when it comes to someone asking for advice, 
 consultation, or simply asking, ""what's your secret?"", 
 i have to blush & say ...
 
persistence and personality.
 
of course, i always follow the advice with my own little 
 disclaimer: what makes me successful may not work the 
 same for you ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 
clearly, it is not. it's not unknown. it's not unattainable. 
 it's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches.
 
one thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an 
 internet consultant, author and internet success 
 strategist is that so many people on the net seem to 
 have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 between themselves and success on the net. it's 
 almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 long, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 their online venture, that ""success"" is the  equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 
it's not that difficult, my friends! it is not that complicated!!
 
long-time friend and business associate rick beneteau 
 has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking 
the bank. get it!! 
 http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?im7517_bybtb . 
 but, the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks 
 so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 online venture a success. 
 
and, yes, rick & i come from the same school of 
 ""self marketing"" - marketing you! obviously, that's 
 the core of his excellent new ebook, and i couldn't 
 agree with him more.
 
point being, *you* are everything you do online to 
 succeed. you are your web site, your business, your 
 marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 experiences with your business -- all of it, is you! 
 read his ebook & you'll see more of what i'm saying.
 
the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 between you & internet success. listen to me - it is 
 not real ok? it doesn't exist. there's nothing there 
 to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 
what i'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 when you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 disintegration. it will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow!
 
yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes 
 honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 powerful key to your success ... is you!
 
that may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever 
 uncover in our lifetime! and, trust me, that brick wall 
 won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 
talk about simple!!

our web site is initially designed to get leads, build 
branding, and provide information.......with a 12 month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart. 
we offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site.
our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.
the growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and 
i've been in this business for 25 years. the internet is not 
dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
on-line as well. our site (the first we've developed) has 
exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it 
yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information!

branding. while quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
zesto is our most challenging task.
zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. the problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions.
fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless.

 internet success through simplicityâ â every day of the week, i get questions from people all  
 over the world, including my no bs gimg members,  
 wanting to know some of the most valuable ""secrets"" 
 to my on-going internet success.
 
let me say, above all else, i don't believe there are any 
 *true* ""secrets"" to success on the net. what you do to 
 become successful in the online world is not a ""secret"", 
 in my opinion. most successful people follow simple, clear, 
 repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the 
 net or off.
 
but, when it comes to someone asking for advice, 
 consultation, or simply asking, ""what's your secret?"", 
 i have to blush & say ...
 
persistence and personality.
 
of course, i always follow the advice with my own little 
 disclaimer: what makes me successful may not work the 
 same for you ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 
clearly, it is not. it's not unknown. it's not unattainable. 
 it's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches.
 
one thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an 
 internet consultant, author and internet success 
 strategist is that so many people on the net seem to 
 have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 between themselves and success on the net. it's 
 almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 long, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 their online venture, that ""success"" is the  equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 
it's not that difficult, my friends! it is not that complicated!!
 
long-time friend and business associate rick beneteau 
 has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking 
the bank. get it!! 
 http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?im7517_bybtb . 
 but, the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks 
 so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 online venture a success. 
 
and, yes, rick & i come from the same school of 
 ""self marketing"" - marketing you! obviously, that's 
 the core of his excellent new ebook, and i couldn't 
 agree with him more.
 
point being, *you* are everything you do online to 
 succeed. you are your web site, your business, your 
 marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 experiences with your business -- all of it, is you! 
 read his ebook & you'll see more of what i'm saying.
 
the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 between you & internet success. listen to me - it is 
 not real ok? it doesn't exist. there's nothing there 
 to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 
what i'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 when you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 disintegration. it will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow!
 
yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes 
 honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 powerful key to your success ... is you!
 
that may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever 
 uncover in our lifetime! and, trust me, that brick wall 
 won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 
talk about simple!!

our web site is initially designed to get leads, build

we offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments

our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.

eliminator's all natural ingredients help you
sleep!â â â â â â  1r
is snoring
keeping you up all night? no
more sleepless nights with
snore eliminator!!
let your family sleep again by using the snore eliminator!
do you know someone with a snoring problem? snore eliminator will help them
and they will love you for it.
improve your sexual performance by reducing snoring and thus increasing
oxygen to your body!!people who snore have a higher risk of developing heart attacks, high blood
pressure, or strokes!! snoring
also causes sleep disturbances that lead to increased anxiety,
hyperirritability, and decreased memory!
individuals who snore have a 90% chance of daytime fatigue. nine out of every
ten victims are male!how the snore eliminator will help you!what causes snoring?over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle
excessive fat on the throat
accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and
throat swelling from allergies and food
heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the stopping
of breathing, during sleep. as
an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. this can be a very hazardous
problem if someone is not getting proper rem sleep. snoring is the audible
symptom of a blocked airway during sleep.the noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
to take in a weakened current of incoming air. this blockage may result
from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
problem.
snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who sleep on their
backs; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.the hidden dangers of snoring?
snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated
hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring
snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical conditionsnoring decreases sexual performance
by half, due to lack of oxygen
to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.
most people who snore have a shortage
of oxygen for a
significant portion of that person's life. in recent studies, daytime fatigue
and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. in a few cases, heavy
snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. sleep apnea in which
breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
snorting and tossing around. this pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
night long. the result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.how the snore eliminator works!snore eliminator offers a unique break through with its all natural
enzymes which metabolize the
secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. the
herbs reduce tissue swelling. the result is to open the airway and smooth the
airflow. this in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. it also
reduces the noise made by
breathing through the mouth while sleeping.
by simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
is coated. this allows the throat
a chance to relax thus a
reduced amount of snoring. in most cases snoring is eliminated. snore eliminator
coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.testimonials from several of our satisfied customers:lorenzo writes...
i am having a good nights sleep, finally. i used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as i would not always go back to sleep. sleeping
through the night is great. thanks a lot snore eliminator.
ps: my girlfriend loves it as much or more than i do.
alex writes...
my husband uses it for another reason. he has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. while he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. when he takes snore eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.
thank you for a product that has really helped us!

had been in years. thanks.

5 ways to create a unique website
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design. this is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites. these
five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design
for your website.1. navigation systemdeciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. i would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. look at webmasterbase 
(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. there is a list 
of categories on the left, and information about the network 
on the top bar.it is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:- people see the top of the page first
- if you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.2. color schemewhen you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. for
example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white.a wonderful utility that is web-based and free is color schemer
(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by aaron
epstein. many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors. try doing a search on freewarefiles 
(http://www.freewarefiles.com), tucows (http://www.tucows.com),
or download.com (http://www.download.com) for ""color schemer.""3. content windowthis is the brain of the website. make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand.also, provide your own original content. people do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say. they want to hear what 
you want to say! while it might be time consuming to write
your own content, it sure is worth it.to find content for your website, try searching at
ezinearticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). other people may
have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the
authors, they may send you new content as they write it. be
careful though. do not use too much content from other 
authors, as mentioned above.4. font(s)several types of fonts exist. the first one i will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to courier or courier new.
fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like html.)another type of font is called sans serif. it is similar to
arial (windows) or helvetica (macintosh). this font can be 
used for long pieces of text.the final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. often, this font is called times
(windows) or georgia (macintosh). this font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. it is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it
easier to read.5. advertisingah, everybody's favorite... advertising! this is one of thing 
that almost every website has. the most common type is what 
is known as ""banner"" advertising. it is called that because it is 
long and thin (like a paper banner.) how long you ask? the 
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.new sizes however are being used. take for example the new
style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it looks
like a skyscraper. it is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too
wide (about 100-125 pixels.)finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. banners 
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.
nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.    conclusionthese are only five things to consider when designing a
website. there are many others however. let me know what 
you find that helps you create a unique website. my email

1. practice gratefulness. reflect upon the things in my life for
which i'm grateful. if i appreciate more of what i have, i will
have even more to appreciate.2. write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when i have achieved them. feel it. 
experience it in as much sensory detail as i can possibly 
imagine.3. take some action steps toward each of the three goals.4. exercise my body and monitor carefully what i eat and 
drink. reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. eat only small amounts at one time.5. read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.6. meditate. empty my conscious mind and listen to the
super-conscious.7. have fun doing something i love to do. experience joy.8. write something--anything. if not an article or part of 
my book, then write in my journal.9. perform some act of kindness. do a thoughtful, 
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.10. finish something. do something i can call complete.bonus step: make something work better -- 
practice ads: automate, delegate and systemize.

~~~~~~~~~no. this is a funny thing to me.  i hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their ss#.  well folks, 
i can get your ss# for 50 cents.  give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time i can get the number.  we are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  they could do 
who knows what with the cc number.  i once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  i told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was ok.  then i asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  i told her to ask her lawyer that too.  never 
heard back from her.  the bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  have a good day.
--  terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~yes. i believe that the risk is out there but minimal. however, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a veri secure sign or others. also, never leave your information stored at a site. i put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! of course, i mostly shop at my own internet 
mall and i know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. overall, i believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--  catherine f.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com 
~~~~~~~~~yes. i had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my isp was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  i had a full service account.  
my internic fees were not paid so my web address 
went unprotected.  a russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.schoolofgeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  thus, i lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 search engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  this set me back about 4  months: i believe i 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
i have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  the first 
time i lost almost 4 months of work.  now, i back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  this is also internet 
theft.  these people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  i sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

we all
need a good attorney to call in today's society.
keeping ahead of the legal issues in our life was just simply more than we could
bear. we needed legal advice and we needed it right away. unfortunately, being middle class, put us in the wrong income bracket to have such a necessity. now all of this has changed.
think about the issues that can suddenly come up in your personal life:monday: the dog bit the mailman - do you know what to do?
tuesday:  the building inspector drops by and announces that the permits on file with their office do not
    allow your garage conversion. ""what now,"" you think to yourself.
wednesday: you've been considering home-schooling your children for some time. now your daughter announces that she is being picked on yet again, and simply will not attend another day. what are the legal ramifications of home schooling your children?â 
thursday: speeding ticket goes to warrant for your 17-year-old son. you haven't a clue how to handle
    it.â 
friday:  your ex-spouse has missed another child support payment. . . who do you call?and what about all the other things:received a traffic ticket you thought was unjustified?
paid a bill you knew was unfair?
lost a security deposit?
bought a home or purchased a car?
signed an employment contract?
had difficulty collecting an insurance claim?
had trouble with your credit report?
been involved in a landlord or property dispute?
been involved in a separation or divorce?
had to collect child support?
prepared a will or wanted to?
in your personal life, you need legal representation available to you all the time. but most of us never have it because we can't afford it.now there is a program that not only provides quality legal help,
 but it provides it 24 hours a day, with an attorney helping you the same day you call them -
 and it is for a small monthly fee. no kidding.  somewhere between twenty and forty dollars a month, depending upon the plan you choose.

am i correct, i hope?actually, i am not quite sure... did i or natasha fedorova write 
you before to your other address? anyway, now i am here instead of 
her too.so, my name is oksana svetlova, i live in st. petersburg, russia.i have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, 
possibly you will find it interesting.people are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?the thing is that i could get you in touch with developers from
russia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for
considerably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or 
pay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. also - all
programming, internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content
writing, translations, etc. if you do web-design, then you may
accept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and
devote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.
alternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more
features to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from
$12, and an average of $18 an hour.i have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.htmlas for reliability, i just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their
specialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.
so, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet 
deadlines. also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant 
is online in icq and other instant messengers almost each day, also 
their company has local consultants in many states throughout the 
usa, in europe and australia.so, what do you think? a possibility for cooperation?thank you very much,
oksana svetlova.
oksana@antee.comps. just in case you need any type of it works now, please let me 
know a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation.

department of minerals and energy
pretoria, south africa.
good morning,it is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues.
i venture to write to you perhaps you will see it fit to assist my
colleagues and i in all honesty as we attempt to seek your assistance.i have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution
of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it
confidential because of the nature of this business.within the department of minerals and energy where i work as a director
of audit and project implementation, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we
have in our possession an overdue payment in us funds.the said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed
on behalf of my department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the
amount of us$29,200,000.00 (twenty-nine million two hundred thousand us dollars).
though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed.since the present elected government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed,
so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental
agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the department of finance and the
reserve bank of south africa (rbsa). we are seeking your assistance to front as the
beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.
details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and
approvals will be secured on behalf of you/your company.i have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be us$7.3m (25%) while my colleagues and i receive
us$18.98m (65%) and the balance of us$2.92m (10%) for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.this business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality.
it does notmatter whether you/your company does contract projects, as a transfer of
powers will be secured in favour of you/your company. also, your specialization is not a
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. i have reposed my confidence in you
and hope that you will not disappoint us.kindly notify me by telephone on 27-83-750 9598 or fax 27-73-219 9975 for
further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.may god's blessings be with you even as you reply.regards,

dear sir.first, i must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.i am the manager bills and exchange of foreign remittance department of union bank of nigeria (u.b.n. headquarters lagos nigeria) formally union bank of switzerland(ubs-ag zurich switzerland). in accordance with federal government policies on indiginalization law on company and allied matters of jan 1977. i am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.we discovered an abandoned sum of us$7. 5 million(seven million five hundred thousand united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along side his entire family in november 1997 in a plane crash. since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.to this effect, i and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.we need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the banks treasury as unclaimed fund. every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and i will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, so you have nothing to worry about.we have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and i. if you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your bank particulars, private telephone and fax numbers.i await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.once i receive your reply, i will send you the text of application for immediate application of claim.yours faithfully,dr markus phillips.

dear sir.first, i must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.i am the manager bills and exchange of foreign remittance department of union bank of nigeria (u.b.n. headquarters lagos nigeria) formally union bank of switzerland(ubs-ag zurich switzerland). in accordance with federal government policies on indiginalization law on company and allied matters of jan 1977. i am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.we discovered an abandoned sum of us$7. 5 million(seven million five hundred thousand united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along side his entire family in november 1997 in a plane crash. since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.to this effect, i and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.we need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the banks treasury as unclaimed fund. every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and i will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, so you have nothing to worry about.we have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and i. if you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your bank particulars, private telephone and fax numbers.i await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.once i receive your reply, i will send you the text of application for immediate application of claim.yours faithfully,dr markus phillips.

1,"request for urgent business relationship dear sir,
 
firstly, i must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. this is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly confidential and ï¿½top secret.ï¿½ 
though i know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but i am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. we have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. so we
decided it is best using the email. let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you. i am dr. osaro ame, a director general in the
ministry of mines and power and i head a three-man
tender board appointed by the government of the
federal republic of nigeria to award contracts to
individuals and companies and to approve such contract
payments in the ministry of mines and power. the
duties of the committee also include evaluation,
vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign
and local contractors in the ministry.i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. in order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. the source of this funds is as follows: between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. however, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of us$11.5million
dollars (eleven million five hundred thousand united
states dollars) in excess. this was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. the federal government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.we need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the federal government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. we are
handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service
code of conduct, does not allow us to operate
off-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction is highly needed . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of us$11,500,000.00 (eleven million five
hundred thousand united states dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. in return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. it does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  more
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. we are civil servants and we will not
want to miss this once in a life time opportunity.you must however, note that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. we have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: (a). our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. (b). that you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. (c). that upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. (d). you must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in ten
bank working days from the date of receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my email
address and i will bring you into the complete picture
of this transaction when i have heard from you. your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. thank you and god bless. yours faithfully, dr. osaro ame __________________________________________________

                        your business today and in the future!!!                        hi, my name is daniel and i have been involved in internet 
                        marketing since its inception. e-marketing provides individuals 
                        and businesses with a low cost solution for broad-based 
                        advertising                        if you are new to this concept do not fret! i was too! 
                        it took me over 2 years of research by scowering the internet, 
                        dealing with false claims, hassling with the (so-called) 
                        ""bulk-mail specialists"" experiencing the trials 
                        and errors ""bogus"" software programs and false 
                        claims they make, to truly understand the ins & outs 
                        of marketing concepts and principles of email marketing.these 
                          processes are time consuming, resource intensive, frustrating 
                          and potentially expensive for individuals and companies 
                          to do on their own.
let's 
                          face it! most people in business want to make money! 
                          their time is consumed by running their business, developing 
                          marketing campaigns and advertisement, cashing checks, 
                          dealing with customers, managing their staff and so 
                          on!
they 
                          don't have time to invest in learning 10 or 15 different 
                          software applications, learn how to effectively port 
                          scan for ips, socks and smtp relays, spend thousands 
                          of dollars for ""the best"" software applications, 
                          spend hours testing applications for the best results 
                          or for that matter, spending 2 or more years to learn 
                          what someone else has already mastered!
if 
                          you are interested in increasing your effectiveness 
                          with email marketing, increasing your client base, maximizing

here is what our customers are saying about the temple â€œ3â€ ragga dagga (tm) phenomenon:â€œto whom it may concern,i was skeptical when i first read your ad.  i grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  i was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  so i knew my stuff.  but drug tests stopped that!  now i am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  i was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  now i have something just as good; temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  i also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the capillaris herba made into tea works and smells great!  your products that i tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  that is hard to find nowadays in a company.  who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  i will be a customer for life!  also, i talked with a lady on the phone when i was ordering, and asked her to find out if i could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  and just send the customers to you.  or get a discount on products that i could sell retail to people.  i would prefer the earlier one becau!
se!
, i can just talk about your products, i am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), i could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. i am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  this deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  you would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  i would like to be doing something, even if i would get on social security disability.  it is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things i used to do!  at least i would be able to do something worthwhile.  and great products makes it real easy to sell.  let me know what you think?sincerely,rjâ€location: midwest, u.s.a.â€œthank you so much for the ragga.  it is everything you guys claim, and then some!  i was a bit skeptical when i read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  how nice that this is non-prohibited!  it tastes great and feels great too!  i am so glad i took a chance and ordered.  blessings to all of you.â€-- frankie r.location: west coast, usaâ€œiâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and i really know my stuff.  i donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  i used to have to take valium in the past.  not anymore with the temple â€œ3â€.  it really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the lebanese and blonde stuff i used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  i am very satisfied with all of your products.  i like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  whoever makes this stuff is an artist at it.  who would have thought?!â€  -- a.j.location: united kingdom

and this is just the tip of the iceberg ...
as you read on you'll discover how a 'seen on national tv'
program is paying out excellent returns, every 4 to 5 months
from your home, for a minimal initial startup investment of
only $25 us dollars. all thanks to the computer age
and the internet!this is the letter you have been hearing a lot about recently.
due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national
weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
can make people money.this is what one had to say: '' thanks to this profitable 
opportunity. i was approached many times before but each time 
i passed on it.  i am so glad i finally joined just to see what 
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money 
required.  to my astonishment, i received a 6 figure income 
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''.
pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey.=====================================================================
here is another testimonial: '' this program has been around for 
a long time but i never believed in it.  but one day when i received 
this again in the mail i decided to gamble my $25 on it.  i followed 
the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money 
started to come in.  first month i only made a small amount of money,  
but the next 2 months after that i made a total of a good 6 figures.  
so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, i have made 
a lot more and i am playing it again.  the key to success in this 
program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything.''  =====================================================================
more testimonials later but first:*****print this now for your future reference & follow these
simple instructions to make your financial dreams true! *****instructions:
============
**** order all 5 reports shown on the list below.**** for each report, send $5 u.s. cash, the name & number
of the report you are ordering and your e-mail address to
the person whose name appears on that list next to the report.  make sure your return address is on your envelope
  top left corner in case of any mail problems.  **** when you place your order, make sure
       you order each of the 5 reports ****you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your
computer and resell them.your up-front cost is only $5 x 5 = $25.00.*********within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. save
them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to
send to the 1,000's of people who may order from you.
also make a floppy of these reports and keep it at your desk
in case something happens to your computer.**********important - do not alter the names of the people
who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the
list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps
1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of your profits.
once you understand the way this works, you will also see how
it does not work if you change it.remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,
it will not work! people have tried to put their friends/relatives
names on all five thinking they could get all the money. but it
does not work this way. believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened.so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed.
because if you do, it will not work for you.  remember,
honesty reaps the reward!!!1. after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in
report # 5. this person has made it through the cycle and is
no doubt counting their money.2. move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5.
3. move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4.
4. move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3.
5. move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2.
6. insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.please make sure you copy every name & address accurately!
=========================================================take this entire letter, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. do not make any other changes.
save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any
data.to assist you with marketing your business on the internet,
the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable
marketing information that includes: how to send bulk e-mails
legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much, much more.there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:  method # 1: sending bulk e-mail legally
  =======================================
let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how
it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out
only 5,000 e-mails each.  let's also assume that the mailing
receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much
better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. also, many people
may send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only
5,000 each).continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.
with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.
those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each
for a total of 50,000.  out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders.  that's = 100 people responded and
ordered report #2. those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  the 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for report #3.those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
5 million e-mails sent out.  the 0.2% response to that is
10,000 orders for report #4.  those 10,000 people send out
5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million)
emails.  the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
report #5.that's 100,000 orders times $5 each = $500,000.00 (a half
million).  your total income in this example is:
  1..... $50 +
  2..... $500 +
  3..... $5,000 +
  4..... $50,000 +
  5..... $500,000 ......... grand total = $555,550.00  numbers do not lie.  get a pencil & paper and figure out
  the worst possible responses and no matter how you
  calculate it, you can still make money!
-----------------------------------------------------------
  remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people
  ordering out of 5,000 people you mailed.dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,
or 1/2, or even one 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails
each or more?  there are over 500 million people on the
internet worldwide and counting.  believe me, many people
may do just that, and more!  method # 2: placing free ads on the internet
  ===================================================
advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there
are hundreds of free places to advertise.  placing a lot of
free ads on the internet can easily get a larger response.
we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method
# 2 as you go along.for every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
report they ordered.  that's it!  always provide same day
service on all orders. this will guarantee that the emails
they send out, with your name and address on it, will be
prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the
report.  order each report by its number & name only.note:  always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report.
checks or money orders are not accepted.  make sure the cash
is wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in
the envelope. on one of those sheets of paper, write the number
and the name of the report you are ordering, your email address,
your name and postal address. make sure you affix proper
'international' postage if ordering a report from outside your
country.place your order for these reports now:

*************************************************
if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within
2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that
you should receive 100 orders or more for report #2.  if you
did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.once you have received 100 or more orders for report #2, you
can relax, because the system is already working for you!this is important to remember: every time your name is moved
down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.you can keep track of your progress by watching which report
people are ordering from you.  if you want to generate more income send another batch of
e-mails and start the whole process again!!!
  ____________________________________________________  following is a note from the originator of this program:follow the program exactly as instructed. do not change it
in any way.  it works exceedingly well as it is now.
remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you
have put your name and address in report #1 and moved others
to #2...........# 5 as instructed above.  one of the people
you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them.  remember though, the more
you send out the more potential customers you will reach.so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information,
materials and opportunity .... it is up to you now!==================== more testimonials======================'' my name is mitchell.  my wife, jody and i live in chicago.  
i am an accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make 
pretty good money.  when i received this program i grumbled 
to jody about receiving ''junk mail''.  i made fun of the 
whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and 
percentages involved.  i ''knew'' it wouldn't work.  jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later 
she jumped in with both feet.  i made merciless fun of her, 
and was ready to lay the old ''i told you so'' on her when 
the thing didn't work.  well, the laugh was on me!  within 
3 weeks she had received 50 responses within the next 45 days 
she had so many orders and ... all cash! i was shocked.  i
have joined jody in her ''hobby''. 
mitchell wolf m.d., chicago, illinois
==============================================================='' not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make 
up my mind to participate in this plan.  but conservative that 
i am, i decided that the initial investment was so little that 
there was just no way that i wouldn't get enough orders to at 
least get my money back''.  '' i was surprised when i found my 
medium size post office box crammed with orders.  i made a large 
6 figure income in the first 12 weeks.  the nice thing about this 
deal is that it does not matter where people live.  there simply 
isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''.
dan
sondstrom, alberta,
canada
================================================================'' i had received this program before.  i deleted it, but later 
i wondered if i should have given it a try.  of course, i had no 
idea who to contact to get another copy, so i had to wait until 
i was e-mailed again by someone else ........ 11 months passed 
then it luckily came again ...... i did not delete this one! i 
made a six figure income on my first try and all the money came
within 22 weeks''. 
susan de suza, new york, n.y.
================================================================'' it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money 
with little cost to you.  i followed the simple instructions 
carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in.  my 
first month i made a substantial income and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was a healthy 6 figure income.
life is beautiful, thanks to internet''.

1,"some opportunities only come around every 30
years or so. this is one of those. why?because interest rates are definitely rising.have you locked in the lowest rate (in three
decades yet!) for your present mortgage?rates haven't been this low in almost 3 decades.
they may well never be this low again--ever. if
you haven't taken this opportunity to secure the
best possible rate on your home loan, you're
simply letting money slip through your fingers.at a few special times, it is so easy to save
""big bucks""...and this is one of those times. why
continue to pay more than is necessary and
continue to let future savings slip away?
  
we're a national mortgage provider. we're not a
broker. as such, we can guarantee you the lowest
possible rate and the best possible deal but only
if you act now.
 
there is no charge, cost or obligation to see if
this opportunity meets your needs. you can easily
determine if a new loan makes sense for you, and
exactly why, because we provide only ""easy to
understand"" quotes (in ""layman's terms"", in other
words).
 
we offer primary and secondary home loans and we
will be happy to show you in ""black and white""
why your existing loan is the best for you or why
you should replace it. of course, there's no cost
to you at all to share your time with us. none. take 2 minutes and use the link below that works
best for you. for 2 minutes of your time, we'll
show you how you can save you and your family
""big bucks"" today. this is a once-every-30-years
opportunity. so don't delay and ""miss the boat"".

email:edum@hkem.com. dear sir, i am mr.eduado de mello, one of the principal 
commanders of the union for the total independence of 
angola,unita.well needless telling a very long story 
here for our story is indeed interwoven with the 
history of the world and the liberation struggle in 
the southern african region of the african continent. 
the bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme 
commander, the late dr.jonas savimbi was killed in an 
encounter with the government forces of the mpla 
government of my country.the rest is now history but 
suffice it to say that i am tired of the unfortunate 
role of waging a war against my fatherland.i have 
therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush 
even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am 
therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life 
and i have decided to make south africa my new home at 
least for the interim period until i am sufficiently 
sure that i would be welcome home whole heartedly by 
the mpla government in luanda the capital of angola. 
needles to say i was the single most important 
commander who was very close to the late supreme 
commander; dr.jonas savimbi.indeed because i am a 
brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great 
deal.the result of such trust is my reason for 
contacting you i was the commander whom he sent to 
deposit the sum of thirty two million usd ($32million) 
with a security/finance company in south africa.this 
was immediately after the events of september 11,2001 
in the united states of america.indeed it had become 
increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money 
around the world particularly for a liberation 
movement like unita hence the recourse to keeping the 
money with the security company in south africa. i 
have decided to inherit this money which was taken out 
and deposited with the said security/finance company 
as cash in hundred dollar denominations.the money is 
kept in my signature and would have been used in the 
purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of 
continuing the civil war in angola.the supreme 
commander is dead and as already stated i have decided 
to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to 
the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! 
i want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit 
the $32million.i am still in the bush here but i have 
been able to establish contact with the company in 
south africa to the effect that i would soon come to 
take possession of the money that i kept with them. 
note also that i deposited the money as a foreign 
national who is the head of a mining company in angola 
(never as a commander of unita). if you are able to 
cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% 
of the $32million.please come back to me through 
email: edum@hkem.com.the security/finance 
company is standing by to receive my instructions on 
this and i will link you up with them as soon as you 
are ready to take possession of the $32million. 
finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to 
state your residential or company address and if 
possible send a copy of your international passport so 
as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. 
yours truly,

attn: president/c.e.o. 
  
dear sir, 
  
i am mr. 
thema ordi, manager of bills/exchange at the foreign remittance 
department of absa bank limited. in my department, we discovered an 
abandoned sum of us$12.5,000,000 (twelve point five million us 
dollars only) in an account that belonged to one of our foreign customers who 
died along with his entire family on november 1994 in a ghastly plane 
crash. since we got information about his death, we have been expecting 
his next-of-kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot 
release it unless somebody applied for it as next-of-kin, or relation to 
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. unfortunately, 
nobody has come foward to claim this money. 
  
it is based on this that some officials in my departement and i have 
decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you, hence 
my contacting you. we want you to present yourself as the next-of-kin 
or relation of the deceased so that the fund can be remitted into your 
account. 
  
moreover, we do not want the money to go into the government account 
as unclaimed bill. the banking law and guidelines here stipulate that 
any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years is deemed 
closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government 
treasury account. 
  
now it is being speculated that the above sum will be transfered into 
the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before december 
2002. the reason for requesting you to present yourself as next-of-kin 
is occasioned by the fact that the deceased (customer) was a 
foreigner. 
  
the mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your 
account: 60% to my colleagues and i; for the role you will be expected 
to play in this deal, we have agreed to give you thirty percent (30%) 
of the total sum, and 10% for the expenses we are going to encounter by 
the two parties at the course of this transaction.therefore you are 
expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to 
participatte in this business. 
  
after receiving your reply, you will be communicated to with the exact 
steps to take. 
  
i expect your urgent response either by email to :othema2002@37.com    
 to enable us conclude this transaction on your reply i shall call you and give 
you my phone number for security reasons.
urgently. 
  
please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for 
security reasons.

email fax: 1 561 619 2791
email:mrjoemark@yahoo.comdear sir
 
request for urgent business relationship ï¿½ strictly
confidential.
 
firstly, i must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. this is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly confidential and ï¿½top secret.ï¿½ though
i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make
anyone apprehensive and worried, but i am assuring you
that all will be well at the end of the day. we have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. so we
decided it is best using the email. let me start by
first introducing myself properly to you. i am dr.
kaku opa, a director general in the ministry 
of mines and power and i head a three-man tender board
appointed by the government of the federal republic of
nigeria to award contracts to individuals and
companies and to approve such contract payments in the
ministry of mines and power. the duties of the
committee also include evaluation, vetting and
monitoring of work done by foreign and local
contractors in the ministry.i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. in order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. the source of this funds is as follows: between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. however, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of us$11.5million
dollars (eleven million five hundred thousand united
states dollars) in excess. this was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. the federal government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.we need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the federal government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. we are
handicapped 
in the circumstances as the civil service code of
conduct, does not allow us to operate off-shore
accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction. my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of us$11,500,000.00 (eleven million five
hundred thousand united states dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. in return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. it does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  more
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. we are civil servants and we will not want
to miss this once in a life time opportunity.you must however, note that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. we have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: (a). our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. (b). that you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. (c). that upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. (d). you must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in ten
bank working days from the date of  receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email
address mrjoemark@yahoo.com. i will bring you into
the
complete picture of the transaction when i have heard
from you. your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. thank you and god bless. yours faithfully, mr joe mark__________________________________________________

=====================================================================================
you are getting this email because you are on a list of people that want all the money  they  can spend without working for it...you will only get this once, so please do nothing  
if you would like to be removed! (by doing nothing you will automatically be removed )
=====================================================================================we really are looking for truly lazy people that dream about being able to do what they 
want, when they want and do so without working.
we want the type of people that drive by a house and say that they want that house some 
day, but would love to own that house through money generated while they sleep or while 
they are on vacation.we want the type of people that would like to send their children to ""harvard"" or 
""stanford"" and have these educations paid for through money generated while they sleep or 
while they are on vacation.we want the type of people that see a new t-bird, corvette or jaguar and want to own these 
cars and have them paid for through money generated while they sleep or while they are on 
vacation.we want the type of people that on a whim want to travel to maybe maui in the winter or 
alaska in the summer and while there if they choose to buy a home in either place, they can 
do so through money generated while they sleep or while they are on vacation.we want the people that would like to sleep till noon if they choose to or get up and go to 
the country club to play golf if they choose to and do so because they always have a stream 
of income through money generated while they sleep or while they are on vacation.we want the type of people that truly hate the thought of getting up in the morning and 
making money for some one else.we want the type of people that deep down want to tell some snob that thinks he's a big 
deal because he or she drives a mercedes, that the rolls royce that you are driving is paid 
for and tomorrow you might buy yourself a porche and if you are in the mood to, you might 
buy your wife or friend a bmw.  in other words, you deep down want to tell the snobs of the 
world, that they really are managing their debt, but you have what you want when you want 
and you have it all with no debt and you have all of this through money generated while you 
sleep or while you are on vacation.seriously, if you want more money than you can spend and you really, truly do not want to 
work, then you are the type of person we are looking for.if you would like to know why some people can do this...then simply send a blank email with 
the words: ""i hate to work"" in the subject area to:

you want, the education for your children that you would like them to have, go on the 
vacation you want, when you want all through money generated while you sleep or while you 
are playing golf or while you are on vacation.also, we do not want you to hear from us again if the idea of making all the money you want 
is not exciting to you...therfore this is the first and last email you will get unless we 
hear from you...so if you want to get rich with out working, then simply send a blank email

1,"thank you for your interest!judgment courses offers an extensive training
course in ""how to collect moneyjudgments""if you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
money judgment is and why processing money judgments
can earn you very substantial income .if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a money judgment against them.you are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""its now up to you to collect on the
judgment"". the court does not require the loser to pay you.
the court will not even help you. you must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. the result is that millions of
judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""in 79% of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a
dime.""the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. right now in the united states there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney
judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid, 5more
judgments take its place.we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued judicial judgments since. we invented this
business. we have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.with our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing money judgments.by following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of money judgments.the income potential is substantial in this profession. we
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in money judgments that we are currently
processing. of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
joint ventures are where we make our money. we only break
even when our course is purchased. we make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. the norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments.
annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. this is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. if you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. the judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. the judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.the way we train you is non-confrontational. you use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. you
never confront the debtor. the debtor doesn't know who you
are. you are not a collection agency.simply stated the steps to successful money processing
are as follows:mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with money judgments. (we train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. they call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.you send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. this applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. we offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. they range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
the prices of our reports are very low. typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. for example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)when you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original judgment holder.once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of
judgment to the court. (included in the course)quote's from several of our students:thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""i just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. my
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
you have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
there's no stopping me now. recently thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""after only having this course for four months, larry s. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""i am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. i am having a ball. i have over $250,000 in
judgments i am collecting on now""after having our course for 7 months larry s. in 314 stated
""i am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments i am collecting on. looks like i
will have to hire someone to help out""marshal in area code 407 states to us ""i feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. i
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">from the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:with our course you can own your own successful business.
a business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. a business which is
extremely interesting to be in. a business in which every
day is new and exciting.none of your days will be hum-drum. your brain is
challenged. a business, which protects you from corporate
downsizing. a business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. a business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. a business, which lets you
control your own destiny. our training has made this happen
for many others already. make it happen for you!if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.please call us at 1-281-500-4018.we have service support staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (central time) 7 days a week . if you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel.
they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. when you call our customer support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. if you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the customer support person
can work with you to place your order. we are very low key. we
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.thank you for your time and interest.+++++

dear friend
 
 i am the first son of the late mobutu sese seko, the
former
 president 
 of the congo republic. i am presently under
protective custody
 in nigeria
 as
a political refugee. i got your contact over the internet during my
search for a
 stranger
 that
can cooperate with me in this mutual transaction.i took this option because my family friends and associates cpuld not be trusted any more since they contributed to my present predicament.
 
i want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us.
 however, 
you must confirm your ability to handle this because
it involves
 a large
amount of money. the money (50 million us dollars is
my share of
 my
 father's
estate. i boxed and shipped the money to a security
company
 abroad at the
peak of the war/political crisis that rocked my
country few
 years ago. now
the crisis has ended and i need a trustworthy person
like you to
 proceed to
the place of the security company in order to clear
the fund and
 invest on
my behalf as i dont want my name to be used for now.
 
note that i will send to you the relevant documents
that will
 enable 
you take possesion of the the fund for onward
investment for our
 mutual 
benefit. all i need from you is as follows:1. a letter of committment (duely signed) that you
will keep the
transaction strictly confidential.
2. your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. your international identity or driving licence
number for
 identification
to the security company.
4. your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
5. your full permanent address.
 
as soon as i get the above information from you, i
will disclose
 to 
you the name and the country of the security company.
i will
 forward your
name and particulars to the security company to enable
 them contact you
accordingly. i will also send to you a letter of
authority to
 enable you
clear the fund on my behalf. note that this is a very
safe
 transaction as
this money is my share of my father'sestate.
 
 i am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.

.if you're sick of scams, then read this, and do what it says.i will make you a promise. read this email to the end, follow the
instructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your
retirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... ever. i
know what you are thinking. i never responded to one of these
before either. then one day i realized that i throw away $25
going to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing
this same $25 in a system that just might work. i don't know why
that day i decided to take a chance, but i can't even come close
to imagining if i hadn't - i guess i'd still be poor.read on.  it's true. every word of it. it's legal, and it's ethical.
not only are you making money from your own business, you're
helping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams.
give it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get
at least a modest return on your start up capital.
okay - here's the scoop on cashbynet (cbn):==================================================due to the popularity of this particular email business, and the
business potential of the internet, a national weekly news program
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program
to see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money.their findings proved that there are ""absolutely no laws prohibiting
the participation in the program, and if people can follow a few
simple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only
$25 in startup costs.""due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this program has
attained, it is currently working better than ever.  the more people
who participate, the better off you become, and the more income you
will make.this is what one had to say:""i was approached many times before to participate in cash by net, but
each time i passed on it. one day i decided that instead of going out
that night, i would take the money i would have spent - invest it in
this business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed.
two weeks went by . . . . nothing.  three weeks . . . . $50 dollars
rolled in.  at this point i was just relieved to get my money back.
then it happened - one week after this, i opened my mailbox to find
$580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  its been about 8 months now, and i
just bought a new mercedes . . . black :)  the startup costs are so
small, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week.
give it a shot - what do you have to lose?""pam hedland, south bound brook, new jersey.
==================================================another said:""programs like this have been around for a long time but i never
believed in them. but this year i won a $50 bet on the patriots to
win the super bowl.  i got this email the following morning, and i
felt like gambling.  i spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other
$25 paying a parking ticket.  i followed the instructions
meticulously - i thought i would at least get my original $25 back.
as soon as i got the email out, not one week went by before i quadrupled
my $25.  i'd take that over the patriots any day.  i got excited, and
that's when it started to explode.  in less than 6 weeks i was already
up $9500 bucks.  it's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped.
on an average day, i get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.  i always
say that everything happens for a reason, and i feel that this was meant
to be, maybe it is for you too. just stick to the steps, do everything it
says - and all of your hopes and dreams will be real - i promise.""greg moran, boston, ma.for more success stories and photos, go to http://www.cashbynet.net$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$follow the simple instruction below and your financial dreams will come
true, guaranteed.be sure to save a copy of this email as a text document for reference!!!!
instructions:=====order all 5 reports from your personal cbn money list below =====for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the report you are
ordering and your e-mail address to the person whose name appears on
that list next to the report. make sure your return address is on your
envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems.=== make sure you order each of the 5 reports ===
you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer
and redistribute them. your total start up investment: $5 x 5 = $25.00.within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports
from these 5 different individuals. save them on your computer so they
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. also make a floppy of these reports and keep it
on your desk in case something happens to your computer.important - do not alter the names or sequence of the people who are
listed next to each report.  follow the instructions 1-6 very closely
or you will lose out on the majority of the profit which is due to
you!! once you understand the way this works, you will also see how
it does not work if you alter it. remember, this method has been
tested, and proved and if you alter it, it will not work !!!this is a legitimate business. you are offering a product for sale and
getting paid for it. treat it as such and you will be very profitable
in a short period of time, and have something many people can't - a
profitable business enterprise (and more money to do whatever you could
possibly want).for more information go to http://www.cashbynet.net==================================================

=======================1.. after you have ordered all 5 reports from your cbn money list, take
this original saved email and remove the name & address of the person in
report # 5.  this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt
counting their fortune.2.. move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5.3.. move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4.4.. move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3.5.. move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 26.. insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.please make sure you copy every name & address accurately!
this is critical to your success.==================================================
**** save the new modified email, as this will be the official document
which you will send to prospective customers. be sure to have your name
in the #1 position and that you do not make any other changes to this
document. this is critical to the performance of your business and
subsequently the size of your profits.****as soon as you receive all 5 reports via email save a copy of them!
these are the products that your customers are paying for. not only do
these reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture,
you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment.
to assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to
send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified
ads and much more.there are 2 primary methods you will use to get this venture going:
method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally
==================================================let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails
each. let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2%
(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just
say it is only 0.2%). also many people will send out hundreds of
thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). continuing with this
example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. that's=100
people responded and ordered report # 2.those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000
e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3.those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail
sent out. the 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for report # 4.those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000
(50 million) e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
report # 5.that's 100,000 orders times $5 each = $500,000.00 (half a million
dollars).your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....
$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... grand total=$555,550.00remember, this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of
5,000 you mailed to. dare to think for a moment what would happen if
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails
each or more?the numbers don't lie. visit cbn at
http://www.cashbynet.net/calculator/ to
plug in your own numbers and see the results.
method # 2: by placing free ads on the internet
==================================================advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds
of free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the internet
will easily get a larger response than just emails alone. we strongly
suggest you start with method # 1 and add method #2 as you begin to
become more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports.
remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure
proper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you.
$$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.=== after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you
should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2. if you did not,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.**once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2, you can
relax, because the system is already working for you, and the cash
will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember: every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a
different report.you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are
ordering from you. if you want to generate more income send another
batch of e-mails and start the whole process again. there is no limit
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================following is a note from the originator of cash by net:cash by net has become a very popular business for many sole
proprietors.  however, this program will only work if you are willing
to put in the time and effort to make it work.  this is not a program
for everybody.  if you are just a passer by, and don't have a personal
vision of success, delete this now.  life all comes down to a few
opportunities - this is one of them. have the courage to be free, and
have the drive to reach your goals.  before you start working with us,
take 10 minutes and write down your personal goals.  what do you want
in 5 years? 1 year? 6 months? be realistic - set your goals high enough
so you will work hard to reach them. remember: you are the owner of your
own destiny, make these goals become reality - only you know what needs
to be done.you now possess the ideas, information, materials, and opportunity to
become financially independent and reach your highest dreams.  i hope
you come along for the ride, it's a wonderful world ahead.copyright cashbynet 2000

1,"this e-mail ad is being sent in full compliance with u.s. senate bill 1618, title #3, section 301to remove yourself send a blank e-mail to:removal992002@yahoo.comhi,you most likely have seen or heard about 
""the letter"" $5.00 paypal program"" that has been seen lately 
on 20/20 and oprah winfrey...etc... how would you like 
to generate more income through a different avenue? what 
if it took only an hour to set it up? even if you are already in another 
program, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and do this one as well. 
there 
is no limit to the income you can generate from this business!!the facts are simple;- if you need to make a few
thousand dollars really fast, then this program i'm going to share with 
you 
is the way to do it! it's the fastest, easiest program you will ever do!!!here's something which (i trust) will be of interest
to you! please read all of this. this is not something 
that i would normally look at, except that i read an 
article in the wall street journal on 6/16/2001 about 
paypal and, when i came across this concept i knew it 
would work because, as a member of pay pal, i had
already experienced their efficiency and good standing. 
you can complete this whole process in one hour and you 
will never forget the day you decided to do so!!! oh! 
did i say fast? by fast i mean 'the speed of the 
internet-type fast.' everything is done on the
internet by e-mail.need proof? here are just two testimonials from
individuals who decided to invest nothing more than a 
little of their time.testimonials from:tony stevens, vandenberg afb, ca:
hey! i got your e-mail! you rock! i sent it to all of
our frat brothers.....and while i haven't seen my $20 
grand yet, i'm up to $8,285. hook me up when you run 
this program again........mary gathers, columbia, sc:
hey cuz! this is mary. i only have one thing to say to
you... oh my god! i sent 20 e-mail's out like you said 
and went on vacation. when i got back, my account was 
up to over $12,000! i owe you!getting started.if you're not already a user, the very first thing you
need to do is go to paypal and sign up. it takes two minutes 
and paypal will deposit $5.00 in your account. that makes this 
program free!here's the link:https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.combe sure to sign up for a premier (free) account! or you'll be limited to 
$100 
dollars only!!! you will make much more than this!!!then...... e-mail $5.00 from your paypal account ($5.00 free) 
to the first name on the list (no.1) along with a little note
like ""please add me to your mailing list."" be prepared to get
excited.... you 
won't be disappointed!!! don't laugh! try this while you wait for the 
others 
to start working. one hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. no 
printing, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to us 
postal and 
lottery laws, title 18, section 1302 and 1341, or title 18, 
section 3005 in the us code, also in the code of federal 
regulations, volume 16, sections 255 and 436, which state a 
product or service must be exchanged for money received). here's how it works. unlike many other programs, this 
three level program is more realistic and much, much
faster. because it is so easy, the response rate is very 
high, very fast-internet e-mail fast-and you will see 
results in just two weeks or less! just in time for next 
months bills! you need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 
or more as in other programs). ideally, you should
send them to people who send their programs to you or to 
personal contacts who are already working on the web, 
because they know these programs work and they are already 
believers in the system! besides, this program is 
much, much faster and has a higher response rate! even if you are already 
in 
another program, stay with it, but do
yourself a favor and do this one as well. start right now! it's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. it will pay off long 
before others even begin to receive letters! just give one 
person a $5.00 gift (remember though, this $5.00 is the $5.00 you get 
when 
you sign up for your new paypal account). that's all! if you already have 
a 
paypal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 
gift 
to
the person in the no.1 spot and add your name on the list 
at no.3 position having moved up the remaining two. follow 
the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 
in your bank account!because of the virtually zero investment, speed and high profit 
potential, 
this program has a very high response rate! all from just one $5.00 
transaction that you get from paypal!!!follow these simple instructions: e-mail the $5.00 from your paypal account to the first 
name on the list (no.1) along with a note saying 
""subscribe me to your mailing list"". only the first 
person on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. edit the list, removing the first (no.1) name from the list. move the 
other 
two names up and add your name. don't try to add your name in the first 
place 
in order to earn money fast! 
if you do that, you will only reach people you send e-
mail to then your name will be immediately removed
from the no.1 place and you can't reach more people! but if 
you add your name on the no.3 place, there will be tons of 
people receiving e-mail's later and when your name is no.1!!! note: do not forget to replace the paypal referring url in 
the body of the letter with your own paypal referring url. 
send out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.also note: by sending this letter and the payment via e-mail, the 
response 
time is much faster... electronic transfer internet fast! consider this! millions of people surf the internet
everyday, all day, all over the world! here are the 3 people 
to start with. sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move 
the other two up to nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own 
e-mail address at no.3. be sure to use your email address that is 
associated 
with your paypal account.*************************************1.  csreddy3@rediffmail.com2.  tomk4@prodigy.net3.  larryspaypal@yahoo.com *************************************there are fifty thousand new people who get on the
internet every month! an excellent source ofemail addresses 
is the people who send you offers by email.
the source is unlimited! it boggles my mind to
think of all the possibilities! mail, or should i 
say 'e-mail', your letter and payment today! it's 
so easy. one hour of your time, that's it!
to send your letter by e-mail, copy this entire page
and paste it in the message of your e-mail. to do this:
1. go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and ""select all""
2. go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and select ""copy""
3. start (compose) a new e-mail message (make sure
it's plain text so everyone can view it!)
4. fill in your address and subject box
5. go to ""edit"" and ""paste"" (then you can format it
anyway you want!)
now you can edit the addresses with ease. delete the
top name, adding your name and address to the bottom 
of the list, then simply changing the numbers. remember, 
your name goes on the bottom and the other 2 names move up. but do not 
forget 
to send $5.00 via paypal (along 
with your note) to the position #1 - top e-mail
address before deleting it!note: be sure to replace the paypal referring url in
this e-mail of the letter with your own paypal 
referring url;
https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com
there's nothing more to do.
when your name reaches the first position in a few
days, it will be your turn to collect your money!
the money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people
like yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to 
receive $20,000 in cash! that's all! there will be a 
total of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your mailbox (account) 
in two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! this is 
real money that you can spend on anything you wish!
just deposit it to your own bank account or spend it 
directly from your paypal account!!! it's just that 
easy!!! i think it's worth it, don't you?go ahead--- try it!!! even if you make just 3 or 4
thousand, wouldn't that be nice?if you try it, it will pay! can you do it again? of
course you can---this plan is structured for everyone to send only 20
letters each. however, you are certainly not limited 
to 20. mail out as many as you want. every 20 letters 
you send has a return of $20,000 or more. if you can 
e-mail forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, go for it! 
the more you put into it the more you get out of it! each time you run 
this 
program, just follow steps 1
through 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! 
simple enough? you bet it is! besides, there are no 
mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the 
printer or copier, and you can do it again and again 
with your regular groups or gift givers, or start up 
a new group. be sure and pay the first person on the 
list. this is proof that you paid to get put on the 
list which is the service rendered to make all this 
legal!!! why not? it's working! each time you receive 
an mlm offer, respond with this letter! your name will 
climb to the number one position at dizzying rates. 
follow the simple instructions, and above all, please 
play fair. that's the key to this program's success. 
your name must run the full gamut on the list to produce 
the end results. sneaking your name higher up on the list 
will not produce the results you think, and it only cheats 
the other people who have worked hard and have earned the 
right to be there. so please, play by the rules and the 
$$$ will come to you!
$$$ e-mail your letters out today! together we will 
prosper! $$$ you are probably skeptical of this, 
especially with all the different programs out there 
on the web, but if you don't try this you will 
never know. that's the way i felt. i'm glad i did it!
i've been watching this type of program for years and
this is about as easy and fast as you can get it and 
it can even be free to try now with pay pal, no stamps, 
no envelopes, no copies to be made - just a little effort 
and faith!!! this program really ""keeps it short and simple""! oh by the way....each time someone signs up with your link 
under your name... you also make $5.00 from paypal...
so they pay to open up the account but they also pay you when 
someone signs up from being referred by you. awesome! 
let's all make some serious money 
$$$$$$click here to begin:https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.complay by the rules, this doesn't cost anything but your
time, and if everyone plays fair everyone wins.
following are some notes about paypal which you may find helpful:paypal 
lets 
you pay anyone with an e-mail address and is the world's no.1 online 
payment 
service - it's accepted on over 3 million ebay t auctions and thousands 
and 
thousands of online shops. you can also use paypal to 
pay your friends - example; it's a convenient way to 
split the phone bill with your roommate, send cash to your kids in 
college,or 
send cash to someone in another country. better yet, you can also 
earn $5 while you do it. each time someone signs up for an account and 
completes the refer-a-friend requirements, we'll give you a $5 bonus! 
when 
you send money through pay pal, you can fund your payments with your 
credit 
card or checking account. you won't have to worry about your privacy, 
because 
paypal keeps your accounting information safe. making a purchase with 
paypal 
is more secure than mailing a check or giving your credit card number to 
a 
stranger. that's why over 9 million people from around the world use 
paypal 
to move money.
signing up for a paypal account is easy. it takes only
a couple of minutes and, if you complete the bonus 
requirements paypal will automatically add $5 to your 
account balance. to learn more about paypal visit the 
web site athttps://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com""best of the web"" -forbes
""using the service is actually safer than a check or
money order""- wall street journal
""paypal can play a major role in your life. you can
use it to pay for stuff at auction sites, settle 
dinner debts with friends or nudge your cousin to 
repay that $50 he borrowed at the family reunion.- time
ps. does this sound too good? well maybe to some skeptics it
is. but it actually works, and is worth 
the few minutes of your time now. 
p.s.s. if you decide to join in on this venture please return a blank 
email 
to the last email address on the list (#3) with ""thanks, i'll join"" in
the 
subject line. this helps everyone keep track of their progress. you will

            who wish to make lots of money without working.         we are not looking for people who are self-motivated.
         we are not looking for people who join every 'get rich 
                   quick' scheme offered on the internet.            we are not looking for class presidents, beautiful 
            people, career builders or even college graduates.  
   we don't even want union workers or trade school graduates.         we want the laziest people that exist - the guys and 
       gals who expect to make money without lifting a finger.             we want the people who stay in bed until noon.    we want those of you who think that getting out of bed to go 
      lay on the couch is an effort that is best not thought about.                          if you meet these criteria, go to:                         livinghealthytoday@hotmail.com              and type in the subject line the following words:
                             ""i do not want to work"".              in fact, if you are so lazy that typing those words 
             in the subject line is an effort, than don't bother.           just click on the email and we'll know that you want 
     us to send you the domain name anyhow, because then 
              we will be absolutely certain that you are the 
                             kind of person we want.
       
               in case you haven't figured it out yet, we want 
                 the kind of people who do not take risks.          if you are the kind of person who will consider doing 
     something that's not a 'sure thing', then do not respond.                    this is too easy a way to make money 
                         and there's no challenge in it.            if you can get to the website that we are going 
              to email you, you will be able to see the first 
       home business in history that requires no work.  none.                 by clicking on this email and then going to 
               this website, you will be telling us that you 
            want to make enough money that you can quit 
                     your regular job and sleep all day.               we are not looking for a commitment from you 
                   and we don't even want your money.               as a matter of fact, we don't even want you 
            to hear from us again if the idea of making lots 
           of money without working does not interest you.                                    so this is the first

                                    ever send you.   
                                  that is a promise.                        so if nothing else, remember this -

here is what our customers are saying about the temple â€œ3â€ ragga dagga (tm) phenomenon:â€œto whom it may concern,i was skeptical when i first read your ad.  i grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  i was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  so i knew my stuff.  but drug tests stopped that!  now i am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  i was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  now i have something just as good; temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  i also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the capillaris herba made into tea works and smells great!  your products that i tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  that is hard to find nowadays in a company.  who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  i will be a customer for life!  also, i talked with a lady on the phone when i was ordering, and asked her to find out if i could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  and just send the customers to you.  or get a discount on products that i could sell retail to people.  i would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, i can just talk about your products, i am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), i could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. i am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  this deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  you would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  i would like to be doing something, even if i would get on social security disability.  it is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things i used to do!  at least i would be able to do something worthwhile.  and great products makes it real easy to sell.  let me know what you think?sincerely,rjâ€location: midwest, u.s.a.â€œthank you so much for the ragga.  it is everything you guys claim, and then some!  i was a bit skeptical when i read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  how nice that this is non-prohibited!  it tastes great and feels great too!  i am so glad i took a chance and ordered.  blessings to all of you.â€-- frankie r.location: west coast, usaâ€œiâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and i really know my stuff.  i donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  i used to have to take valium in the past.  not anymore with the temple â€œ3â€.  it really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the lebanese and blonde stuff i used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  i am very satisfied with all of your products.  i like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  whoever makes this stuff is an artist at it.  who would have thought?!â€  -- a.j.location: united kingdom

1,"greetings -i understand you are interested in making some money, and thought
you might be interested in this. a few months back i joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. you may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.the program was free to join so maybe i just didn't take it very seriously.anyway, near the end of may i received a letter from my 
sponsor (vic patalano) informing me that i had more than 1000 
paid members in my group! as you can imagine, i was very skeptical. after all, how could i 
have more than 1000 paid members under me in a program that i had
never promoted?i took the time to check out the site...then wrote to vic asking 
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free 
sign-ups...like me :)well, it was true...i had over 1000 paid members in my group. this 
is a program that i had never worked! all i had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end 
of the month and i would have my position locked in and a group of over 1000
 people. you can bet i wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!i can tell you, if i had known what was happening with this program,
 i would have become an active paid member months ago! with this program, you will get a huge group of paid members.
my sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every
month...on time.how would you like to lock your position in free while you check
out this opportunity and watch your group grow?to grab a free id#, simply reply to:  sejr102@yahoo.com
and write this phrase:""email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities""
be sure to include your:
1. first name
2. last name
3. email address (if different from above)once i receive your reply, i will submit your information and you 
will receive an e-mail titled ""your name, activate your free membership today!"" you will then need to confirm your free membership.
we will then send you a special report, along with your free membership id number and also let you know how you can keep track of your growing group, then you can make up your own mind.that's all there is to it.warm regards,sean p.s. after having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies i had pretty much given up on them.
this company is different--it offers value, integrity, and a
real opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for free.  all you need to do is get your free
membership.

question: 
        are you paying too much for life insurance? most 
        likely the answer is yes!

        you, while offering the new lower rates (up to 50%, even 70% lower) to 
        their new buyers only.        but, don't take our word for it... click 
        hereâ and request a free online quote. â be prepared for a

1,"thank you for your interest!judgment coursesoffers an extensive training
course in ""how to collect moneyjudgments""if you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
money judgment is and why processing money judgments
can earn you very substantial income .if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a money judgment against them.you are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""its now up to you to collect on the
judgment"". the court does not require the loser to pay you.
the court will not even help you. you must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. the result is that millions of
judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""in 79% of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a
dime.""the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. right now in the united states there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney
judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid, 5more
judgments take its place.we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued judicial judgments since. we invented this
business. we have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.with our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing money judgments.by following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of money judgments.the income potential is substantial in this profession. we
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in money judgments that we are currently
processing. of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
joint ventures are where we make our money. we only break
even when our course is purchased. we make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. the norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments.
annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. this is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. if you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. the judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. the judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.the way we train you is non-confrontational. you use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. you
never confront the debtor. the debtor doesn't know who you
are. you are not a collection agency.simply stated the steps to successful money processing
are as follows:mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with money judgments. (we train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. they call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.you send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. this applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. we offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. they range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
the prices of our reports are very low. typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. for example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)when you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original judgment holder.once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of
judgment to the court. (included in the course)quote's from several of our students:thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""i just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. my
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
you have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
there's no stopping me now. recently thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""after only having this course for four months, larry s. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""i am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. i am having a ball. i have over $250,000 in
judgments i am collecting on now""after having our course for 7 months larry s. in 314 stated
""i am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments i am collecting on. looks like i
will have to hire someone to help out""marshal in area code 407 states to us ""i feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. i
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">from the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:with our course you can own your own successful business.
a business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. a business which is
extremely interesting to be in. a business in which every
day is new and exciting.none of your days will be hum-drum. your brain is
challenged. a business, which protects you from corporate
downsizing. a business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. a business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. a business, which lets you
control your own destiny. our training has made this happen
for many others already. make it happen for you!if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.please call us at 1-281-500-4018.we have service support staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (central time) 7 days a week . if you callthis number

they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. when you call our customer support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. if you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the customer support person
can work with you to place your order. we are very low key. we

1,"from: dr. ben kokoricompliments of the season.  i would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this letter.  before going into details of my proposal to you, i must first implore you to treat with the utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success. my colleagues and i are senior officials of the federal government of nigeriaï¿½s contracts review panel (crp) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the central bank of nigeria. in order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. we are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2002. the source of the funds is as follows: during the last military regime in nigeria, government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. the present civilian government set up the contract review panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. my colleagues and i have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the central bank of nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. however, by virtue of our positions as civil servants !
and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in nigeria. i have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of u.s.$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million, five hundred thousand u.s.dollars). that is why i am writing you this letter.
we have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;  (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for us (the panel officials   (iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.we wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. we
intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above_-:your bank's name, companyï¿½s name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which  the funds should be paid. the above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. this way, we will use your companyï¿½s name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. we are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction.

the united states has a program, called diversity immigrant visa
lottery (better known as the green card lottery), making available
each year by random selection 50,000 permanent residence visas
(green cards) to people from around the world. the objective of the
program is to issue green cards to individuals born in countries with
historically low levels of immigration to the united states.
a green card is a permanent residence visa of the u.s.a. a green card
will give you legal right to work and live permanently in the united
states. green card holders receive health, education, and several other
benefits. if you win a green card, you can apply for u.s. citizenship at
a later time. the green card does not affect your present citizenship.
you and your family could be lucky winners!

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthank you for your interest!judgment courses offers an extensive training
course in ""how to collect moneyjudgments""if you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
money judgment is and why processing money judgments
can earn you very substantial income .if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a money judgment against them.you are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""its now up to you to collect on the
judgment"". the court does not require the loser to pay you.
the court will not even help you. you must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. the result is that millions of
judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""in 79% of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a
dime.""the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. right now in the united states there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney
judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid, 5more
judgments take its place.we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued judicial judgments since. we invented this
business. we have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.with our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing money judgments.by following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of money judgments.the income potential is substantial in this profession. we
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in money judgments that we are currently
processing. of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
joint ventures are where we make our money. we only break
even when our course is purchased. we make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. the norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments.
annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. this is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. if you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. the judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. the judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.the way we train you is non-confrontational. you use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. you
never confront the debtor. the debtor doesn't know who you
are. you are not a collection agency.simply stated the steps to successful money processing
are as follows:mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with money judgments. (we train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. they call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.you send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. this applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. we offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. they range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
the prices of our reports are very low. typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. for example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)when you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original judgment holder.once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of
judgment to the court. (included in the course)quote's from several of our students:thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""i just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. my
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
you have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
there's no stopping me now. recently thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""after only having this course for four months, larry s. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""i am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. i am having a ball. i have over $250,000 in
judgments i am collecting on now""after having our course for 7 months larry s. in 314 stated
""i am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments i am collecting on. looks like i
will have to hire someone to help out""marshal in area code 407 states to us ""i feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. i
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">from the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:with our course you can own your own successful business.
a business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. a business which is
extremely interesting to be in. a business in which every
day is new and exciting.none of your days will be hum-drum. your brain is
challenged. a business, which protects you from corporate
downsizing. a business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. a business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. a business, which lets you
control your own destiny. our training has made this happen
for many others already. make it happen for you!if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.please call us at 1-2`8`1-5`0`0-4`0`1`8.we have service support staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (central time) 7 days a week . if you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel.
they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. when you call our customer support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. if you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the customer support person
can work with you to place your order. we are very low key. we
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.thank you for your time and interest.

have a blast in bed,
guaranteed!
finally, a safe and natural penile enlargement
supplement!
 naturally boost your sex drive and rejuvenate sexual
function.
good news, men! recent
discoveries in herbal medicine have made it possible for men to
safely and effectively boost their sexual vitality while increasing
their penis size by 25% or more!
certified natural laboratories is pleased to introduce the
latest addition to their widely acclaimed line of herbal
supplements: maxamanâ„¢.
specially formulated with herbs and extracts from around
the globe, maxamanâ„¢ can help to enhance sexual sensitivity,
increase sexual stamina, and actually increase the size of your
penis by up to 25%. the special blend of herbs in maxamanâ„¢
have been shown to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding
the sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains
in both length and thickness.
a
recent survey showed that 68% of women are unsatisfied with the
size of their partners. of course most of these women would never
tell their partner that they are unhappy with their penis size.
having a small or average-sized penis can result in depression and
feelings of inadequacy. thankfully, men of all ages can now safely
and naturally increase the size of their penis and renew sexual
vitality without resorting to dangerous surgery.
what to
expect:
1-2 weeks
 most men notice more powerful and longer lasting erections almost
immediately. a noticeable increase in thickness is also
common.3-8 weeks
 by this point you should be able to notice an increase in
thickness in both erect and flaccid states, as well as an overall
increase in length.9 weeks +
 after nine weeks, your penis should be noticeably larger in both
length and girth.
â 
below is a comparison chart compiled from the most recent
data on penis size. see how you measure up...
how to measure your penis size
correctly: to determine length, measure the erect penis
from the base of the penis where the top of the shaft meets the
pubic area (the peno-pubic junction) to the tip of the head. for
uncircumcised men the foreskin should be retracted. to determine
width, measure at mid-shaft around the circumference while the
penis is erect.whether you have a small, average or large penis, it is now
possible for you to increase the size of your penis by up to 25%
without resorting to dangerous surgery or cumbersome
weights.

1,"hey there,if you're like me, you've tried everything to lose
weight.  i know how you feel - the special diets,
miracle pills, and fancy exercise equipment never helped
me lose a pound either.  it seemed like the harder i tried,
the bigger i got, until i heard about a product called
extreme power plus.you're probably thinking to yourself, ""oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  like you, i was skeptical at first, but 
my sister swore it helped her lose 23 pounds in just two weeks, 
so i told her i'd give it a shot.  i mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  let me tell you, it was
the best decision i've ever made. period.  six months later,
as i'm writing this message to you, i've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and i haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  yes, i still eat pizza, and lots of it!i was so happy with the results that i contacted the manufacturer
and got permission to resell it - at a big discount.  i want
to help other people lose weight like i did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
i give you my personal pledge that extreme power plus
absolutely will work for you.  if it doesn't, you can return it
any time for a full refund.    if you are frustrated with trying other products, not having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then i recommend the only product that worked for me - extreme
power plus.you're probably asking yourself, ""ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""extreme power plus contains lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. no ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just results, results, 
results!! here is the bottom line ...i can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
just try it for one month - there's nothing to lose, and everything 
to gain.  you will lose weight fast - guaranteed.  that is my
pledge to you.  to order extreme power plus on our secure server, just click

new patented product is designed to repair skin damage & rejuvenate tissue! successfully addresses wrinkles, dark circles, age spots, fine lines, lesions, spider veins, skin tags, scar tissue, cellulite, stretch marks, and more for most people the â“lookgoodduoâ” is hypoallergenic !research, which began many years ago, has concluded that ellagic acid, derived from a compound called ellagitannins, is a very powerful substance. the highest concentration of ellagitannins are found in raspberry seeds. the delivery of the ellagitannins, however, is the key to the effectiveness of the product. we use raspberry seed materials processed using a patented method, which is the only method that guarantees the maximum delivery of available phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants. ellagic acid from raspberry seed ellagitannins is the most powerful and complete polyphenolic, phytoestrogen, antioxidant material yet discovered! these plant based compounds, or phytoestrogens, when absorbed, provide many beneficial effects including stimulation of collagen formation. it is now known that the powerful agents in the raspberry seed materials tone the tiny blood vessels under the eye and decrease the release of the brown chemical pigment. the results are a decrease the appearance of the dark circles under the eyes. these materials also help to decrease the appearance of ""age"" brown spots, while smoothing wrinkles, strengthening hair and nails, and supporting many other significant health issues! cellulite is simply fat that is tethered down because certain cells in our skin are stimulated by estrogens. the phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants from both oral and topical sources of ellagic acid interfere with that tethering process resulting in a smoother skin surface. we offer this patented material in both a tablet and a topical cream. taken both internally and externally, it is easy to understand how they can achieve such obvious results so quickly, working from the inside-out and from the outside-in.  happy users report a healthy â“glowâ” which they have never achieved with any other product! 
product testimonials i've been using the product for a little over a month. i took the ""2 face challenge', and i could tell a difference in only 3 days! the lines on my face and the pores had changed!  i have had people compliment my fingernails. they have been growing like crazy!  c.c., ohthis is a unique, one of a kind product.   i have been using it 3 weeks and i can truly see a difference in the liver spots on my hands. the prescription from my dermatologist didn't do it, but this product did.  m.f., msi have been watching myself very closely, and since using the product, the brown spots on my hand have just about disappeared. the smile lines and the eyelids have really tightened up. no more problems putting my eyeliner on! the skin under my chin has really tightened up.  this is not hard work, it is just sharing the product with family and friends. i have never been rewarded so quickly and so well.   e.p., cak.d., tx i was queen of skeptical.  i did not want to try this.  i am a 54 yr old grandmother.  i have tried everything for years to get rid of cellulite - the creams, the wraps - nothing worked.  my husband kept telling me to try this.  finally i did it just to get him off my back.  i had not worn shorts for 5 years.  after about 10 days, my husband started telling me my legs were looking better.  i thought he was just being nice since he got me into this.   then i went shopping, and in the lights in the dressing room, for the first time in a long time i looked pretty good.  i went into the next dressing room, because i thought the lights were wrong, but i still looked good.  i ended up buying shorts, and have been wearing shorts for the 1st time in 5 years.  yes, it works!! g.c., txwe just had a booth at the womenâ’s expo in dallas.  out of the 300 or 400 exhibitors there, the only other spot that had the people we did were the ones giving out free food.   v.c., txi did the 1 side of the face test, and i did not tell my spouse that i was doing it.  we went to get some  fast food.  he was looking at me, and said â“i can tell you which side you are using it on.  itâ’s your right side.â”  i asked what made him think so, and he said the lines around my mouth and eyes have softened, and the fine lines around my neck.  we are tickled, because everyone we talk to wants it!  j.d., tx â“after using your product for less than a week, i ran into a friend who asked me what i was doing to look so young!  i have a full- time job, but i have made $8,000 since starting this business part time!â“   t.h.,tx

and if people can follow
the simple instructions, they are bound to
make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"". due to
the recent increase
of popularity & respect this
program has attained,
it is currently working better
than ever.this is what one had to say: ""thanks to this
profitable
opportunity. i was approached many times
before but each
time i passed on it. i am so glad i finally
joined just to see
what one could expect in return for the
minimal effort and
money required. to my astonishment, i
received a total of
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still
coming in.""

received this again in the mail i decided to
gamble my $25 on
it. i followed the simple instructions and

five thinking they could get all the money.
but it does not
work this way. believe us, we all have tried
to be greedy and
then nothing happened. so do not try to
change anything
other than what is instructed. because if
you do, it will not
work for you.remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!1.... after you have ordered all 5 reports,
take this
advertisement and remove the name &
address of the
person in report # 5. this person has
made it through the
cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... move the name & address in
report # 4 down to
report # 5.
3.... move the name & address in
report # 3 down to
report # 4.
4.... move the name & address in
report # 2 down to
report # 3.
5.... move the name & address in
report # 1 down to
report # 2
6.... insert your name & address in the
report # 1
position. please make sure you copy
every name &
address accurately!===============================
=============**** take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names,
and save it on your computer. do not
make any other
changes.save this on a disk as well just in case if
you loose any data.
to assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the
5 reports you purchase will provide you with
invaluable
marketing information which includes how
to send bulk e-
mails legally, where to find thousands of
free classified ads
and much more. there are 2 primary
methods to get this
venture going: method # 1: by
sending bulk e-mail
legally===============================
=============let's say that you decide to start small, just
to see how it goes,
and we will assume you and those
involved send out only
5,000 e-mails each.  let's also assume that
the mailing receive
only a 0.2% response (the response could
be much better but
lets just say it is only 0.2%. also many
people will send out
hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of
only 5,000 each).
continuing with this example, you send out
only 5,000 e-
mails. with a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report #
1. those 10 people responded by sending
out 5,000 e-mail
each for a total of 50,000. out of those
50,000 e-mails only
0.2% responded with orders.
that's=100 people responded and ordered
report # 2.those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of
500,000 e-mails.  the 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for
report # 3.those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of 5
million e-mails sent out. the 0.2% response
to that is 10,000
orders for report #4.  those 10,000 people
send out 5,000 e-
mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50
million) e-mails. the
0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
report  # 5.
that's 100,000 orders times $5
each=$500,000.00
(half million).your total income in this example is: 1.....
$50 + 2..... $500 +
3.....$5,000 + 4 . $50,000 + 5..... $500,000
....... grand
total=$555,550.00numbers do not lie. get a pencil
& paper and
figureout the worst possible
responses and
no matter how you calculate it,
you will
still make a lot of money !===============================
=============remember friend, this is
assuming only 10
people ordering out of 5,000 you
mailed to.
dare to think for a moment what would
happen if everyone or
half or even one 4th of those people mailed
100,000e-mails
each or more? there are over 150 million
people on the
internet worldwide and counting. believe
me, many people
will do just that, and more! method # 2 :
by placing
free ads on the internet===============================
=============disclaimer: your earnings and results are highly dependent on your
individual efforts and results. this web page constitutes no guarantees
of any income, whether stated nor implied. any earnings projections
shown on this website are for example and educational purposes only.
actual results will vary according to each individual member's activity. in
general, the more you work the plan the better your results.advertising on the net is very very
inexpensive and there are
hundreds of free places to advertise.
placing a lot of free ads
on the internet will easily get a larger
response. we strongly
suggest you start with method # 1 and
method # 2 as you
go along. for every $5 you receive, all you
must do is e-mail
them the report they ordered. that's it.
always provide same
day service on all orders. this will
guarantee that the e-mail
they send out, with your name and address
on it, will be
prompt because they can not advertise until
they receive the
report.=========== available reports
============order each report by its
number & name
only. notes: always send $5 cash (u.s.
currency) for
each report. checks not
accepted. make sure the cash is concealed
by wrapping it in at
least 2 sheets of paper. on one of those
sheets of paper, write
the number & the name of the report
you are ordering,
your e-mail address and your name
and postal
address.place your order for these
reports now :===============================

$$$$$$$$$ your success
guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$follow these guidelines to guarantee your
success:=== if you do not receive at least 10 orders
for report #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.=== after you have received 10 orders, 2
to 3 weeks after that
you should receive 100 orders or more for
report # 2. if
you did not, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you
do.=== once you have received 100 or more
orders for report #
2, you can relax, because the system
is already working
for you, and the cash will continue to roll in !
this is
important to remember:
every time your name is moved down on
the list, you are
placed in front of a different report. you can
keep track
of your progress by watching which
report people are
ordering from you. if you want to
generate more
income send another batch of e-
mails and
start the whole process again.
there is no
limit to the income you can generate
from this business !!!===============================
=============following is a note from the
originator of
this program: you have just received
information that
can give you financial freedom for the rest
of your life, with
no risk and just a little bit of
effort. you can
make more money in the next few weeks
and months than you
have ever imagined. follow the program
exactly as
instructed. do not change it in any
way. it works
exceedingly well as it is now.remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting
report after you
have put your name and address in report
#1 and moved
others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed
above. one of the people
you send this to may send out 100,000 or
more e-mails and
your name will be on every one of them.remember though, the more you send out
the more potential
customer you will reach. so my friend, i
have given you the
ideas, information, materials and
opportunity to become
financially independent. it is up to you
now !======== more testimonials
============""my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i
live in chicago. i
am an accountant with a major u.s.
corporation and i make
pretty good money. when i received this
program i grumbled
to jody about receiving ''junk mail''. i made
fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and
percentages involved. i ''knew'' it wouldn't
work. jody totally
ignored my supposed intelligence and few
days later she
jumped in with both feet. i made merciless
fun of her, and was
ready to lay the old ''i told you so'' on her
when the thing didn't
work. well, the laugh was on me! within 3
weeks she had
received 50 responses. within the next 45
days she had
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all
cash! i was
shocked. i have joined jody in her ''hobby''.
mitchell wolf c.p.a., chicago, illinois===============================
===========''not being the gambling type, it took me
several weeks to
make up my mind to participate in this plan.
but conservative
that i am, i decided that the initial
investment was so little that
there was just no way that i wouldn't get
enough orders to at
least get my money back''. '' i  was
surprised when i found my
medium size post office box  crammed with
orders. i made
$319,210.00in the first 12 weeks.  the nice
thing about this
deal is that it does not matter where 
people live. there simply
isn't a better investment with a faster return
and so big."" dan
sondstrom, alberta, canada===============================
============''i had received this program before. i
deleted it, but later i
wondered if i should have given it a try. of
course, i had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so
i had to wait until i
was e-mailed again by someone
else.........11 months passed
then it luckily came again...... i did not
delete this one! i made
more than $490,000 on my first try and all
the money came
within 22 weeks."" susan de suza, new
york, n.y.===============================
=============''it really is a great opportunity to make
relatively easy money
with little cost to you. i followed the simple
instructionscarefully and within 10 days the money
started to come in. my
first month i made $20,560.00 and by the
end of third month
my total cash count was $362,840.00. life
is beautiful, thanks
to the internet."". fred dellaca, westport,

e-mail:dr_tomeke@spinfinder.com
lagos - nigeria. attn:  
request for urgent business relationship. it is with my profound dignity that i write you this
very important
and highly confidential letter. first, i must
solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction. this is by
virtue of its nature
as being utterly confidential and ""top secret"".
though i know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and
worried,considering the fact that we have not met
each other before,
but i am assuring you that all will be well at the
end of the day. we
have decided to contact you by email due to the
urgency of this
transaction, as we have been reliably informed that
it will take at
least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal
post to reach you,
so we decided it is best using the e-mail,which is
quicker and also
to enable us meet up with the second quater payment
for the year
2000. however, let me start by introducing myself properly
to you. i
am dr.tom eke, a director general in the department
of petroleum 
resources(d.p.r) and i presently head the contract
award panel incharge
of contract awards and payment approvals. i came to
know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to
handle a very confidential business transaction
which involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account
requiring
maximum confidence. i and my colleagues are top
officials of the
federal government contract award panel. our duties
include evaluation, vetting, approval for payment of
contract jobs
done for the d.p.r e.t.c. in order to commence this
business we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer
into your account
the said funds. the source of this funds is as
follows: in the second
quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to
review and award
contracts to the tune of us$400 million us dollars
to a group of five
firms for the supply construction and installation
of oil pipe lines
in warri and port harcourt. during this process my
colleagues and i
decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately
over-inflate the
total contract sum from us$400 million to us$431
million united
states dollars with the main intention of sharing
the remaining sum
of us$31 miilion amongst ourselves. the federal government of nigeria has since the
second quater of	
year 2001 approved the sum of us$431 million for us
as the contract sum, 
and the sum of us$400 million has also been paid to
the foreign companies 
concerned as contract entitlements for the various
contracts done, but 
since the companies are entiltled to us$400 million
dollars only, we are 
now left with us$31 million dollars balance in the
account which we intend to
disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our
positions as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot do
this by ourselves,
as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau
(civil service
laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts
in our names
while still in government service, making it
impossible for us to
acquire the money in our names right now. i have
therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my
colleagues in the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose
account we would
transfer the sum of us$31 million. hence we are
writing you this
letter. my colleagues and i have agreed that if you
or your company
can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our
behalf, you or your
company will retain 20% of the total amount (us$31
million), while
70% will be for us(officials) and the remaining 10%
will be used in
offsetting all debts/expenses and taxes incurred
both local and
foreign in the cause of this transfer. needless to
say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. in
return we demand your
complete honesty and trust. you must however note that this transaction will be
strictly based 
on the following terms and conditions as we have
stated below; 
a) our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence 
b) that you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality 
c) that you will not ask for more share or try to
sit on the funds once it is under
your custody, or any form of blackmail. 
d) that upon receipt of the funds you will release
the funds as instructed 
by us after you have removed your share of 20% from
the total amount. 
please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude
this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days
from the date 
of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .
we are looking 
forward to doing business with you and solicit your
total confidentiality
in this transaction. there is no cause for alarm. i
give you my word that you
are completely safe in doing business with us.
transactions like this
have been successfully carried out in the past by
most government
executives. here in my country there is great
economic and political
disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant
and the order of
the day, thus explaining why you might have heard
stories of how
money is been taken out of nigeria, this is because
everyone is
making desperate attempts to secure his or her
future, so that when
we retire from active service we donot languish in
poverty. i will
explain more to you when i have heard from you. please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using
the above e-mail address. 
i will bring you into the complete picture of this
pending business
transaction when i have heard from you and also
receive your
confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me
fax to you all
necessary information you need to know about our
pending business
transaction. i will also send to you my private
telephone and fax
numbers where you can always reach me. your urgent
response will be
highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds
under the second
quarter of the year 2002. thank you and god bless. yours faithfully, dr.tom eke. n.b. please be informed that this business
transaction is 100% legal
and completely free from drug money or money
laundering. this is a
complete legitimate business transaction.

have a blast in bed,
guaranteed!
finally, a safe and natural penile enlargement
supplement!
 naturally boost your sex drive and rejuvenate sexual
function.
good news, men! recent
discoveries in herbal medicine have made it possible for men to
safely and effectively boost their sexual vitality while increasing
their penis size by 25% or more!
certified natural laboratories is pleased to introduce the
latest addition to their widely acclaimed line of herbal
supplements: maxamanâ„¢.
specially formulated with herbs and extracts from around
the globe, maxamanâ„¢ can help to enhance sexual sensitivity,
increase sexual stamina, and actually increase the size of your
penis by up to 25%. the special blend of herbs in maxamanâ„¢
have been shown to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding
the sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains
in both length and thickness.
a
recent survey showed that 68% of women are unsatisfied with the
size of their partners. of course most of these women would never
tell their partner that they are unhappy with their penis size.
having a small or average-sized penis can result in depression and
feelings of inadequacy. thankfully, men of all ages can now safely
and naturally increase the size of their penis and renew sexual
vitality without resorting to dangerous surgery.
what to
expect:
1-2 weeks
 most men notice more powerful and longer lasting erections almost
immediately. a noticeable increase in thickness is also
common.3-8 weeks
 by this point you should be able to notice an increase in
thickness in both erect and flaccid states, as well as an overall
increase in length.9 weeks +
 after nine weeks, your penis should be noticeably larger in both
length and girth.
â 
below is a comparison chart compiled from the most recent
data on penis size. see how you measure up...
how to measure your penis size
correctly: to determine length, measure the erect penis
from the base of the penis where the top of the shaft meets the
pubic area (the peno-pubic junction) to the tip of the head. for
uncircumcised men the foreskin should be retracted. to determine
width, measure at mid-shaft around the circumference while the
penis is erect.whether you have a small, average or large penis, it is now
possible for you to increase the size of your penis by up to 25%
without resorting to dangerous surgery or cumbersome
weights.

1,"i saw your email on a website i visited yesterday, and thought
you might be interested in this. a few months back i joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. you may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.the program was free to join so maybe i just didn't take it very
seriously.anyway, near the end of may i received a letter from my
sponsor (vic patalano) informing me that i had more than 2000
paid members in my downline!as you can imagine, i was very skeptical. after all, how could i
have more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that i had
never promoted?i took the time to check out the site...then wrote to vic asking
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free
sign-ups...like me :)well, it was true...i had 2365 paid members in my downline. this
in a program that i had never worked!all i had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end
of the month and i would have my position locked in and a
downline of 2365 people.you can bet i wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!i can tell you, if i had known what was happening with this
program, i would have become an active paid member months ago!with this program, you will get a huge downline of paid members.
my sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every
month...on time.how would you like to lock your position in free while you check
out this opportunity and watch your downline grow?to grab a free id#, simply reply to:gitrman@excite.com
and write this phrase:
""email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities""
be sure to include your:
1. first name
2. last name
3. email address (if different from above)we will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also your free member number.i'll get you entered and let you know how you can
keep track of your growing downline.that's all there's to it.i'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.warm regards,bruce stevensp.s. after having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies i had pretty much given up on them.
this company is different--it offers value, integrity, and a

the united states has a program, called diversity immigrant visa
lottery (better known as the green card lottery), making available
each year by random selection 50,000 permanent residence visas
(green cards) to people from around the world. the objective of the
program is to issue green cards to individuals born in countries with
historically low levels of immigration to the united states.
a green card is a permanent residence visa of the u.s.a. a green card
will give you legal right to work and live permanently in the united
states. green card holders receive health, education, and several other
benefits. if you win a green card, you can apply for u.s. citizenship at
a later time. the green card does not affect your present citizenship.
you and your family could be lucky winners!

work.  how?  by learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called bulk email.if you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  i bet you can't click on 
delete fast enough for most of those ads, right?
you might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the internet.  i 
guarantee it.  now let's go back to math 101 and 
review some numbers ...if you sell on ebay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  how many people see your ad?  maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  using bulk email, you can
send your ad to more than a million people a day
at virtually no cost.  whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
zero!stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  if you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  it's that simple ...all you have to do is convince one person out of a
thousand to buy your stuff and you're filthy rich.the best thing is that anyone can do it.  doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in new 
york city.  anyone, and i repeat anyone, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  all 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the internet.i quit college when i was 19 to capitalize on the 
""dot com"" mania, and i've never looked back.  i 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  i saw an 
opportunity and i seized it.  a few years later, 
i bought my own home - with cash.  you don't need any money.  you don't need a product.
you don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  if you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  it would be a dream come true.
so what are you waiting for?!i'm going to ask you four simple questions.  if you answer
yes to all of them, then i can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.here goes ...do you have basic experience with the web? 
do you have a computer and an internet connection?
do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  if you answer yes to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!all you need is ambition and commitment.  this
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  you have to work
to make big bucks, but anyone - and i mean anyone - can do 
it.you're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
don't worry, it's not! i will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  you'll be generating 
orders - and making money - in less than seven days.okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?no problem!!  i'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like craaaaaazy! most people delay
starting an internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but i'm removing that hurdle right now.  
after reading the bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  there is no excuse 
not to get started! i will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. in fact ...i personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the bulkbook!  i'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!i will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""seven days to 
bulk email success"".  this seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  on day one, for 
example, i teach you where to find a product to sell. 
the next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  on the seventh day, you just click send!  your 
very first campaign is ready to go.as a special bonus, you'll recieve a free copy 
of our stealth mass mailer, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! i'll even

classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  if you are serious about making money 
on the internet, bulk email is your only option.  
what are you waiting for?  few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but i promise to teach 
you everything i know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... the bulkbook! once again, here's the deal.  you give me $29.99.

  $99.95 during this limited time promotion. ) in a business that could make you
  ""financially secure""?
if so, read on:
this is not a get rich quick scheme, but, it is a way for you to get into
  a business with a minimal investment and, may be your first step towards a
  rewarding first, or second income. for the longest time, only those, who were
  able to make large investments were able to take advantage of this type of a
  business. we have made it possible for everyone to do it, and at a price
  everyone can afford.â corporate america has conditioned us to believe that security comes from
  employment. yet layoffs are hitting an all time high, major corporations are
  failing and we hope to never become the victims of this downsizing, career
  burn out, illness or injury.
there was a time, when finding another job was not a problem, but today,
  the frightening reality for a lot of people is that ""the
  plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives.""
the hard facts show that our economy has moved from the industrial age
  into the information, service and retail age. no longer can you depend on the
  corporation to provide your family with the security you seek.

  work a few hours per week, than this may be for you.

you will be able to buy such items as rca stereos that retail for $250.00+
  for $20.00, new boom boxes for $12.50 each, palm pilots for $39.00, cell phone

                   urgent concern pls.i am a serious officer with one of our main branches of citi bank,
consumer banking department. although we didn't have previous correspondence till date.
however, based on the standard value place on everything about you,  i believed we could discuss, analyze and execute this transaction.the transaction is thus:
i've a wealthy client, an american citizen who had been residing in west africa for decades now, he operates a fix deposit account with us which i am his account officer, and also 
receives standing orders  for his chains of dividends share.
however, this client mr. david brown died as an  out come of heart attack,and the funds in his current account has  been claimed by his family, who had gone back finally to usa.
at the end of fiscal year, march 2001, an  accumulated share of us$12.360m was transferred into his account from the stock exchange.
this was alone the instructions we issued to the stock house to dispose all his stocks.now the funds has arrived, i needed an associate whom i would present as the inheritor of this fund i.e. associate partner of mr. david brown so as to receive this fund.
please note, his family has left since,and never  know about this stocks in the exchange and the funds has subsequently matured in his fix deposit account, so i as the account officer 
has prepared all documents for easy claims of this fund.
immediately, you reach me, i will furnish you  with further details and then negotiate on the sharing ratio once you show your sincere involvement to go along with me. it will be of 
need for you to furnish me also your personal phone and fax  numbers for urgent
messages. 
i am anxiously waiting to hear your consent. be guided.thanking you .yours sincerely,dave framo.

1,"greetings! you are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in
receiving information about online business opportunities. if this is
erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. this is a one-time
mailing, so no removal is necessary. if you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level
marketing, mlm, then please read this letter. it could be the most
important one that has ever landed in your inbox. multi-level marketing is a huge mistake for most people mlm has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. the
pursuit of the ""mlm dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their
friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. the fact is that mlm is
fatally flawed, meaning that it cannot work for most people. the companies and the few who earn the big money in mlm are not going to
tell you the real story. finally, there is someone who has the courage to
cut through the hype and lies and tell the truth about mlm. here's good news there is an alternative to mlm that works, and works big! if you haven't
yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. earning the kind of
income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! with your permission, i'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell
you why mlm doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard
of this before. i promise that there will be no unwanted follow up, no sales pitch, no one
will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the
information. period. to receive this free, life-changing information, simply click reply, type
""send info"" in the subject box and hit send. i'll get the information to
you within 24 hours. just look for the words mlm wall of shame in your
inbox. cordially, looking4money p.s. someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most
eye-opening, financially beneficial information i have ever received. i
honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. and
it's free!

here is what our customers are saying about the temple â€œ3â€ ragga dagga (tm) phenomenon:â€œto whom it may concern,i was skeptical when i first read your ad.  i grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  i was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  so i knew my stuff.  but drug tests stopped that!  now i am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  i was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  now i have something just as good; temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  i also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the capillaris herba made into tea works and smells great!  your products that i tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  that is hard to find nowadays in a company.  who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  i will be a customer for life!  also, i talked with a lady on the phone when i was ordering, and asked her to find out if i could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  and just send the customers to you.  or get a discount on products that i could sell retail to people.  i would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, i can just talk about your products, i am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), i could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. i am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  this deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  you would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  i would like to be doing something, even if i would get on social security disability.  it is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things i used to do!  at least i would be able to do something worthwhile.  and great products makes it real easy to sell.  let me know what you think?sincerely,rjâ€location: midwest, u.s.a.â€œthank you so much for the ragga.  it is everything you guys claim, and then some!  i was a bit skeptical when i read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  how nice that this is non-prohibited!  it tastes great and feels great too!  i am so glad i took a chance and ordered.  blessings to all of you.â€-- frankie r.location: west coast, usaâ€œiâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and i really know my stuff.  i donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  i used to have to take valium in the past.  not anymore with the temple â€œ3â€.  it really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the lebanese and blonde stuff i used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  i am very satisfied with all of your products.  i like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  whoever makes this stuff is an artist at it.  who would have thought?!â€  -- a.j.location: united kingdom

1,"what have you been up to?
i don't know about you, but i am sick and tired of going
down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges
cost more than the printer itself! i know how you feel
- i print over 500 pages a day, and it feels like there is
a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet! now, this has got
to stop because i know it doesn't cost the printer companies
anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work!
well, it finally has.  the superink solution.you're probably thinking to yourself, ""gosh darn, not another
cheap knockoff printer cartridge!""â  like you, i was very 
skeptical at first, but my best friend & business associate
said it helped her save over $100 a month on printer supplies. 
so i tried it.â  i mean, there was nothing to lose because they
offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, up to a one-year warranty
on all of their products and free shipping on all orders!
let me tell you, it was one of the best decisions i've ever made.
period.â  six months later, as i'm writing this message to you,
i've gone from spending $1000 dollars a month on printer supplies
to now only $475! and i haven't had to sacrifice the quality or
service that i received from the local office supply store. in fact,
the service is even better!  i've had 1 defective cartridge since 
i started dealing with superink and they sent me a new replacement
within 3 days, no questions asked. now, i can print all i want!i was so happy with the results that i contacted their manufacturer
and got permission to be a reseller - at a big discount.â  i want
to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies
like i did. because a penny saved is a penny earned! 
i give you my personal pledge the superink soltuion will absolutely
work for you. if it doesn't, you can return your order anytime
for a full refund.â  â  if you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the
printer companies, or tired of poor quality ink & toner cartridges,
then i recommend - the superink solution.you're probably asking yourself, ""ok, so how do we save all this money
without losing quality and service?""modern technology has provided superink with unique, revolutionary
methods of wax molding that allow the ink & toner to 'settle', which
prevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and
handling. nothing ""magic"" about it - just quality & savings, big savings!here is the bottom line ...i can help you save 30%-70% per week/per month/per year or per lifetime 
by purchasing any of our ink & toner supplies. just try it once, you'll 
keep coming back - there's nothing to lose, and much money to be saved! 
100% satisfaction guaranteed. you will be able to print as much as you
want without wasting money or sacrificing quality - guaranteed.
that is my pledge to you.â  to order from the superink solution on our secure server, just click

major medical 
            breakthroughhuge profit potential
imagine yourself as part owner of the 
      most interesting, full service state-of-the-art medical facility, equipped 
      with the most sophisticated and effective scanning diagnostic tools 
      available today.
electron beam tomography is a 
      cutting-edge diagnostic technology capable of providing a 
      crystal-ball-like look into your medical future. this technology has been 
      featured on oprah, larry king, good morning america, and usa 
      today.
ebt scans are now covered by most health 
      insurance companies and hmos, causing an explosion in usership and 
      exceptionally high demand for this procedure.
ebt can identify heart disease years 
      before a treadmill test would show an abnormality and many years before a 
      heart attack might occur.
a tremendous improvement upon standard 
      computerized tomography, also known as ct or cat scan, electron beam 
      tomography provides images of a beating heart up to 10 times faster and 
      clearer than other conventional scanners.
the dramatic capabilities of this 
      spectacular technology should provide an extraordinary investment 
      opportunity for those establishing state-of-the-art outpatient clinics, in 
      order to provide the ebt body scan procedures to health conscious 
      americans. projected 10-year return of 916%.
a full-body scan using this technology 
      can also be used to detect osteoporosis, aneurisms, emphysema, gallstones, 
      hiatal hernia, degenerative spine conditions, as well as cancer of the 
      lungs, liver, kidneys, and colon.
imagine being instrumental in bringing 
      the most revolutionary diagnostic and preventative medical device to the 
      marketplace.

wema bank plc. 
lagos/nigeria 
email: ronardtony@mail.com
dear sir, request for co-operation on a private business
relationship every four years, nigeria banks transfer to it s
treasury millions of dollars of unclaimed deceased
depositors funds, in compliance with the banking laws
and guidelines. in the majority of cases, with
reference to my bank   wema bank plc. the money
normally runs into several millions of dollars. until
dr.david fang  death along with his wife, doris, their
two children, micheal and ann in a private jet plane
crash. i was his foreign currency denoted bank account
manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits. ever since his death and up till this time of
writing, no next of kin or relation of his has come
forward to claim his money with us. naturally, as long as late dr.david fang money remains
unclaimed, the bank remains richer in free funds with
his money. however, with my being in direct charge of
bills and exchange in the foreign remittance
department of my bank, i am in position to cause the
payment of this money to whosoever that present
himself as the next of kin or relation of the late
dr.david fang' on private business deal basis. now the game plan and the purpose of writing to you
exclusively having been highly recommended as the
right and proper person to handle this deal by a
management consultant friend of mine, who has traveled
widely, including your country is that i want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000:00
(fourteen million, nine hundred united states dollars)
with your co-operation and assistance by just doing
the following: 
- (a) act as next of kin or relation of late dr.david
fang (b) provide your bank account and location where you
want the money remitted .
(c) provide your direct and private telephone/fax
numbers for effective communication 
(d) give immediate reply to this proposal using the
above tel/fax 
number for details on how to proceed. for your co-operation and efforts, 40% of the money
will be for you as my foreign partner,10% for
settlement of all expenses that might be incurred on
the course of this transaction, while 50% will be for
myself that will eventually visit your country for
disbursement of the fund. looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business
relationship. regards,
ronard tony.

	aren't asian pacfic americans (apas) accorded equal 
opportunity already?  unfortunately, no.  apas are not accorded 
equal opportunity in workplaces presently.  	equal opportunity means: ""for every man, woman and 
child to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability 
will take them.""  statistics, mostly gathered by government 
studies, show that aas have only 1/3 the opportunity of all 
other americans to rise to the top in the academic world, 
corporate world, the federal government.  there seems to exist 
an invisible resistance to aas' developing to the maximal of 
their potentials  --  a glass ceiling.	let's look at a concrete case.  a lot of our best people are 
employed in universities.  their average performance has been 
outstanding.  what's their chance of rising to the top?  	university administrators are recruited almost exclusively 
from the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in 
universities.  hence the ratio of [administrators / (faculty + 
professionals)], broken down to races, is a measure of the 
opportunity enjoyed by american citizens of different races.  
nationwide, that ratio for blacks (non-hispanic) is 0.21.  that is, 
for every 100 black faculty and professionals there are 21 black 
administrators.  the ratio for native american is 0.20; for white 
(non-hispanic) is 0.16; and for hispanic is 0.15.  however, it is 
only 0.06 for asian american.  get on the web and check it out 
for yourself!  source:  dept. of education - , table b-1f.	the above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly 
""enlightened"" academic world.  the situation in the corporate 
world, state and federal governments is worse.  	in e-mail 2 & 3, we present a strategy to induce the two 
major political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and 
help make our beloved nation ""a more perfect union.""   there has 
already been progress on account of that strategy.  behold how the 
glass ceiling in the federal government is being shattered, owing
significantly to the bloc-vote organized and delivered by 80-20 in 
the 2000 election.

1,"in 1957, a monastery in thailand was being relocated and a group of monks
was put in charge of moving a giant clay buddha. in the midst of the move
one of the monks noticed a crack in the buddha. concerned about damaging the
idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.
when night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. he
shined his flashlight over the entire buddha. when he reached the crack he
saw something reflected back at him. the monk, his curiosity aroused, got a
hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay buddha. as he
knocked off piece after piece of clay, the buddha got brighter and brighter.
after hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before
him a huge solid-gold buddha.many historians believe the buddha had been covered with clay by thai monks
several hundred years earlier before an attack by the burmese army. they
covered the buddha to keep it from being stolen. in the attack all the monks
were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant
statue, that the great treasure was discovered. like the buddha, our outer
shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. we
human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. all we
need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our
outer shell, piece by piece.could you be sitting on your own gold mine? did you know the average
american can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? then, why
don't they? it's simple. they haven't been taught that they could. they are
taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money
work for them. they pay too much in taxes. they are wasting money every
month and don't even realize it. in short, they are financially unhealthy.

for life"" and discover the gold within your current income.get your free 3-point checkup and video now!

do. mail servers addresses for specified address are extracted from dns. the 
program tries to connect with found smtp-servers and simulates the sending of 
message. it does not come to the message sending â€¿/nobr> emv disconnect 
as soon as mail server informs does this address exist or not. emv can 
find
â about 90% of dead addresses â€¿/nobr> some mail

addresses and if the address is dead send the message

â 
try it. just for fun. it will cost you 25$ to earn at least thousands of dollars !!! this thing 
is legal because you are buying and selling something of value: marketing reports.
â 
there is my true story.
â 
i received by email the instructions include in this letter. it interests me because the 
system was quite simple. in the list of people selling the reports (as you will see above), 
there was a guy living not so far. i searched for his phone number and i called him. i just 
wanted to know if this system was really working. he told me his business was going 
very well and he was receiving from 50$ to 150$ in cash everyday! that's why i went 
into this thing!
â 
â 
thank's to the computer age and the internet!
=========================================
be an internet millionaire like others within a year!!!
â 
before you say ''bull'', please read the following. this is the letter you have been hearing 
about on the news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national 
weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
described below, to see if it really can make people money. the show also investigated 
whether or not the program was legal.
â 
their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely no laws prohibiting the 
participation in the program and if people can ""follow the simple instruction"" they are 
bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''.
â 
== print this now for your future reference ==
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
â 
if you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, 
please read the following... then read it again and again!!!
â 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
â 
follow the simple instruction below and 
your financial dreams will come true, guaranteed!
â 
instructions:
â 
=====order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
â 
for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the report you are 
ordering and your e-mail address to the person whose name appears on 
that list next to the report. make sure your return address is on your 
envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems.
â 
===when you place your order, make sure ===
===you order each of the 5 reports! ===
â 
you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. 
â 
your total cost $5 x 5 = $25.00.
â 
within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different 
individuals. save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 
1,000's of people who will order them from you. also make a floppy of these reports and 
keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.
â 
important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, 
or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 
through 6 '' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits. once you understand the 
way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. 
â 
remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work!!! people 
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the 
money. but it does not work this way. believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then 
nothing happened. so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed. 
because if you do, it will not work for you. remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
â 
this is a legitimate business. you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. 
treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time.
â 
1.. after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and remove the name 
& address of the person in report # 5. this person has made it through the cycle and 
is no doubt counting their fortune.
â 
2..move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5.
â 
3.. move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4.
â 
4.. move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3.
â 
5.. move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2
â 
6.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.
â 
please make sure you copy every name & address accurately! this is critical 
to your success.
â 
take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. do 
not make any other changes.
â 
save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. to assist you with 
marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with 
invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where 
to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. there are 2 primary methods to 
get this venture going:
â 
method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally
=========================================
â 
let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you 
and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. let's also assume that the mailing 
receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets 
just say it is only 0.2%). also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails 
instead of only 5,000 each).
â 
continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. with a 0.2% response, 
that is only 10 orders for report # 1. those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-
mail each for a total of 50,000. out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with 
orders. that's=100 people responded and ordered report # 2.
â 
those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. the 0.2% 
response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3.
â 
those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. the 
0.2% response is 10,000 orders for report # 4.
â 
those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000(50 million) e-
mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for report # 5. 
â 
â 
that's 100,000 orders times $5 each = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars).
â 
your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... 
$50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... 
grand total = $555,550.00
â 
numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst 
possible responses and no matter how you calculate it, you will 
still make a lot of money !
=========================================
â 
remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 
5,000 you mailed to. dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or 
half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more?
â 
there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands 
more coming on line every day. believe me, many people will do just that, and more!
â 
method # 2: by placing free ads on the internet
=========================================
â 
advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places 
to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. we 
strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method #2 as you go along. for 
every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it. 
always provide same day service on all orders.
â 
this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will 
be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.
â 
=========== available reports ==============
the reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". it is simply 
about time. time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. concealing it 
is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to 
you.
â 
order each report by its number & name only. notes: always send $5 
cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not accepted. make sure the cash is 
concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. on one of those sheets of paper, 
write the number & the name of the report you are ordering, your e-mail 
address and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$
â 
follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
â 
=== if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2 weeks, continue 
sending e-mails until you do.
â 
=== after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 
orders or more for report # 2. if you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails 
until you do.
â 
**once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2, you can relax, because 
the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is 
important to remember: every time your name is moved down on the list, you are 
placed in front of a different report.
â 
you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are 
ordering from you. if you want to generate more income send another 
batch of e-mails and start the whole process again. there is no limit 
to the income you can generate from this business!!!
=========================================
following is a note from the originator of this program: 
you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your 
life, with no risk and just a little bit of effort. you can make more money in 
the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. follow the program 
exactly as instructed. do not change it in any way. it works exceedingly well as 
it is now.
â 
remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and 
address in report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. one of the 
people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on 
every one of them. 
â 
remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. 
so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to 
become financially independent.
â 
it is up to you now!
â 
=============testimonials===============
''my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in chicago. i am an accountant with a 
major u.s. corporation and i make pretty good money. when i received this program i 
grumbled to jody about receiving 'junk mail'. i made fun of the whole thing, spouting my 
knowledge of the population and percentages involved. i ''knew'' it wouldn't work. jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. 
i made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''i told you so'' on her when the 
thing didn't work. 
â 
well, the laugh was on me! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. within the 
next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00......... all cash! i was shocked. i have 
joined jodyin her ''hobby''.
â 
mitchell wolf m.d., chicago, illinois
=========================================
''not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to 
participate in this plan. but conservative as i am, i decided that the initial investment was 
so little that there was just no way that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my 
money back. i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed 
with orders. i made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 
â 
the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. there simply 
isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''. 
â 
dan sondstrom, alberta, canada
=========================================
''i had received this program before. i deleted it, but later i wondered if i should have given 
it a try. of course, i had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so i had to wait until 
i was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came 
again...... i did not delete this one! i made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the 
money came within 22 weeks''. 
â 
susan de suza, new york, n.y.
=========================================
''it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. i 
followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come 
in. my first month i made $20, in the 2nd month i made $560.00 and by the end of third 
month my total cash count was $362,840.00. life is beautiful, thanx to internet''.

1,"20th july, 2002to:    the presidentfrom:  ab sanniassalam aleikum,i wish to seek your assistance in a matter that needs trust secrecy and
confidentiality.i am a. b. sanni, a close confidant to mohammed abacha, son of late
general sani abacha, former head of state federal republic of nigeria, who
ruled from november 17th 1993 to june 8th 1998 when he died suddenly in
office.since then, the family as a whole has been facing all sorts of
harassments, by security operatives/agents of the new head of state
(general obasanjo) who served a jail term under my friend's father for
coup offence. even my friend's old mother has been detained and tortured
many times.  mohammed is now being charged for military decision of his
father's regime e.g. the murder cases of political opponents. these
offences he knows nothing about, as he was only the head of state's son,
not even a military man nor was he in the government. his father ruled for five years during which period he acquired financial
gains and property all over the world from his share of crude oil sales as
the head of state. now, the family has lost all assets (property and money
in nigeria) to the new government. ref. news watch magazine publication of
11th to 18th october, 1999. however, they have hidden records in a secret
name with the nigerian insurance deposit corporation to access a coded
trust accounts in europe valued at three hundred and thirty eight million
united states dollars only ($338,000,000).   mohammed is currently being
detained and tortured to sign off accounts of his late father and he has
done that but not the coded trust accounts in the name of certain
government multinational contractors that i can not disclose now.the aim of this letter is to request your assistance to secure this
account in a safe/confidential bank and help invest the money for our
mutual benefit. we also expect to use some of our share of the money to
relocate ourselves to another safe country because right now nigeria is
not safe and we will like to go into hiding overseas if we can escape.if you are interested in helping secure the accounts please contact me
immediately by email ""a_sanni@email.com"", so that we can arrange an
initial meeting in a neighboring country, thus you can present your
investment program and projects for our assessment.  thereafter we will
sign an mou (memorandum of understanding) binding this business
relationship and immediately entrust you to access the coded trust
accounts in europe valued at three hundred and thirty eight million united
states dollars only ($338,000,000).we will depend on your business experience to make sure that we get
maximum returns on our investment with you.please note that in the process of securing the coded trust account you
are likely to incure expenses but it will be paid back once we secure the
deposit.  it is 100% safe for you and you have nothing to worry about. 
just forward via email your full name, phone number, fax number and bank
details as the new beneficiary to enable us make formal application for
the transfer of ownership to you.we look forward to your helping us, but if you are not interested kindly
discard this letter and still maintain its confidentiality.ma-salam.for mohammed abacha",0,1,0

business with people all over the world (over 160 different 
countries involved)!   join our team and you will succeed!  
we have the people, the knowledge and the ability to guide you...

in fact, if you think you're going to make money overnight with this,
please do not click on the link. simply remove yourself from this

is that the tools you need for proven success... are given to you 
for free after you decide to create your own successful business!  
to verify what i'm saying, ask any local business person if they 
were given the tools they needed to make their business the success 
it is, for free when they started out.they'll laugh at the question!you do not need...
1.  a small fortune to get started.
2.  a lot of ""business knowledge"" or ""business contacts"" to get started.
3.  to commute anywhere, talk to anyone or buy any items to get started.everyday hundreds of people join for free and get the free information 
theyneed to succeed.  when they see that they too can make money with 
this business, they get involved.  there are already over 2 million 
people who have joined for free to check things out.  this business has 
been thriving for over five years!do you have...a.  an internet connection.
b.  one or two hours a day to build your business.
c.  the ability to ask and receive all the help you need to succeed.
d.  the drive to succeed.
e.  the need for extra income each and every month.then you too can make more money for you and your family and you too 
can run your own profitable business!
this is probably the only business in the world where you personally 
reap all the rewards from your personal efforts and not those above

beijing landed in kabul with the most important delegation the ruling taliban 
had ever received.  they had come to sign the contract with afghanistan that 
osama bin-laden had asked for, that would provide the taliban state of the art 
air defense systems in exchange for the taliban's promise to end the attacks by 
muslim extremists in china's north-western regions.  hours later, cia director 
george tenet received a coded ""red alert"" message from mossad's tel aviv 
headquarters that presented what he called a ""worst case scenario"" -- that china 
would use a ruthless surrogate, bin-laden, to attack the united states.  in

1,"gooday,with warm heart my friend, i send you my greetings, and i hope this letter meets you in good time. it will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. however, i am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which i propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. i have kept it to myself for a long time, and now i need to act, as time is not on my side. i want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. i got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. i apologize if this is not acceptable to you. the purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. my name is donald phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to mr. david stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from macheke, zimbabwe. my master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of april 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the mdc (movement for democratic change), the main opposition party to president mugabe's party,  zimbabwe african national union patriotic front (zanu-pf) . for more information on my master's murder, you may check the amnesty international country report on zimbabwe for the year 2001.when the pressure on white farmers started in zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by president mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to johannesburg, south africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (fourten million, five hundred thousand usdollars), in a private security company, for safety. this money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the south african government of thambo mbeki is in support of president mugabe's actions. the box is labeled as gemstones. my master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in botswana. he has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from europe. my master is divorced, and his wife valerie, and only child, diana have relocated to bradford, !
 en!
gland for 9years now. i am currently in the netherlands where i am seeking political asylum. i have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. this is why i am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. you have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.if you accept to assist me, all i want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. you may open a new account for this purpose. i have applied to the security company to transfer the box from south africa to their branch here, which they have done. to legally process the claim of the box, i will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. i have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. for valuable assistance, i am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. i have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to charity in my master's name i will give 25% ($3,625,000) to valerie and diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. when they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account i will solely own. i also intend to start up a business then. if you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that i may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.please, i want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. i look forward to your reply and co-operation, and i am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.yours sincerely,
donald phiri.

subject: earn money sending e-mails.  it's easy!
	     new improved reportsdear friend,you can earn a lot of money in the next 90 days sending e-mail.
seem impossible? is there a catch?  no, there is no catch; just
send your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom. basically, i send out as many of these e-mails as i can, then
people send me cash in the mail for information that i just e-mail
back to them. everyday, i make a three minute drive to my p.o. box
knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for
me.  and the best part, it is completely legal.just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. if you
like what you read, great! if you don't, read it again because you
must have missed something.""as seen on national television"" ""making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home
for an investment of only $25 us dollars expense one time.  thanks
to the computer age and the internet, be a millionaire like others
within a year!!!  before you say, ""no way!"" read the following.
this is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.
due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a major
nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
investigation of the program described below to see if it really
can make people money. the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely
no laws prohibiting the participation in this program. this has
helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way
to make some extra money at home. and, besides even if you never
got involved in the program, the reports themselves are well worth
the money.  they can help you start and advertise any business on
the internet.  that is, these reports stand alone and are
beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet.the results of this show have been truly remarkable. so many
people are participating that those involved are doing much better
than ever before. since everyone makes more as more people try it
out, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. you will
understand once you experience it. ""here it is below"" *** print this now for future reference *** the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in
taking a look at. it can be started with very little investment
($25) and the income return is tremendous!!! this is a legitimate, legal, money making opportunity. it does not require you to come into contact with people, do any
hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave your house
except to get the mail. simply follow the instructions, and you really can make this
happen. this e-mail order marketing program works every time if
you put in the effort to make it work. e-mail is the sales tool of
the future. take advantage of this non-commercialized method of
advertising now! the longer you wait, the more savvy people will be taking your
business using e-mail. get what is rightfully yours. program
yourself for success and dare to think big. it sounds corny, but
it's true. you'll never make it big if you don't have this belief
system in place. multi-level marketing (mlm) has finally gained respectability.  it
is being taught in the harvard business school, and both stanford
research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50%
and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level
methods. 
this is a multi-billion dollar industry and of the 500,000
millionaires in the u.s., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the
last several years in mlm. moreover, statistics show 45people
become millionaires everyday through multi-level marketing. you may have heard this story before, but donald trump made an
appearance on the david letterman show. dave asked him what he
would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch.
without hesitating trump said he would find a good network
marketing company and get to work. 
the audience, started to hoot and boo him. he looked out at the
audience and dead-panned his response. ""that's why i'm sitting up
here and you are all sitting out there!"" with network marketing you have two sources of income. direct
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from
sales made by people you introduce to the business. residual income is the secret of the wealthy. it means investing
time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again.
in network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of
others. the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my
fingers. fortunately, sometime later i reread everything and gave
some thought and study to it.my name is jonathan rourke. two years ago, the corporation i
worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position
was eliminated. after unproductive job interviews, i decided to
open my own business. over the past year, i incurred many
unforeseen financial problems. i owed my family, friends and
creditors over $35,000. the economy was taking a toll on my
business and i just couldn't seem to make ends meet. i had to
refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and
struggling business. at that moment something significant happened
in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that
this will change your life forever financially!!! in mid december, i received this program via e-mail. six month's
prior to receiving this program, i had been sending away for
information on various business opportunities. all of the programs
i received, in my opinion were not cost effective. they were
either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial
investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work
or not. one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one
year. it didn't tell me i'd have to write a book to make it! but like i was saying, in december i received this program. i
didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a
mailing list. thank goodness for that!!! 
after reading it several times, to make sure i was reading it
correctly, i couldn't believe my eyes. here was a money making phenomenon. i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me
further into debt. after i got a pencil and paper and figured it
out, i would at least get my money back. but like most of you i
was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal
aspects of it all. so i checked it out with the u.s. post office
(1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed
legal! after determining the program was legal and not a chain
letter, i decided ""why not."" initially i sent out 10,000 e-mails. it cost me about $15 for my
time on-line. the great thing about e-mail is that i don't need
any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of
my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. i am
telling you like it is. i hope it doesn't turn you off, but i
promised myself that i would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how
much money it cost me. 
here is the basic version of what you need to do: your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report #1
within 2 weeks of your first program going out. if you don't, send
out more programs until you do. your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for report #2
within 4 weeks. if not, send out more programs until you do. once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. you
will make $50,000+ but keep at it! if you don't get 150 right off,
keep at it! it may take some time for your down line to build.
keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted. in less than one week, i was starting to receive orders for report
#1. i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13,
1 had received 26 orders for report #1. my first step in making
$50,000 in 90 days was done. by january 30, 1 had received 196 orders for report #2; 46 more
than i needed. so i sat back and relaxed. by march 1, of my
e-mailing of 10,000, i received $58,000 with more coming in every
day. i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car.
please take time to read the attached program, it will change your
life forever!!  remember, it won't work if you don't try it. this
program does work, but you must follow it exactly! especially the
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. it
won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! in order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal
of 20+ orders for report #1, and 150+ orders for report #2 and you
will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. if you don't reach the first
two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of
money, it may take a few months or so longer. but keep mailing out
the programs and stay focused! that's the key.  i am living proof
that it works!!! if you choose not to participate in this program,
i am sorry. it really is a great opportunity with little cost or
risk to you. if you choose to participate, follow the program and
you will be on your way to financial security. if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble
like i was, or you want to start your own business, consider this
a sign. i did!  -sincerely,  jonathan rourke p.s.  do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look
like piled up on a kitchen table? it's awesome!a personal note from the originator of this program: by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you
should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal,
could not have been created by an amateur. let me tell you a little about myself. i had a profitable business
for 10 years. then in 1979 my business began falling off. i was
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but
it wasn't working. finally, i figured it out. it wasn't me; it was the economy.
inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had
been with us since 1945. i don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment
rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. there
were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. the middle class was vanishing. those who knew what they were
doing invested wisely and moved up. those who did not including
those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down
into the ranks of the poor. as the saying goes, 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.""
the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to
""move up"" or ""get rich"". inflation will see to that. you have just received information that can give you financial
freedom for the rest of your life, with ""no risk""and ""just a
little bit of effort."" you can make more money in the next few
months than you have ever imagined. follow the program exactly as instructed. do not change it in any
way. it works exceedingly well as it is now. remember to e-mail a
copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. one of
the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name
will be on everyone of them! remember though, the more you send out the more potential
customers you will reach. so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.  it is up to
you now! ""think about it."" before you delete this program from your
mailbox, as i almost did, take a little time to read it and really
think about it. get a pencil and figure out what could happen when
you participate. figure out the worst possible response and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!
you will definitely get back what you invested. any doubts you
have will vanish when your first orders come in. it works! -jody
jacobs, richmond, va here's how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar$ this method of raising capital really works 100% every time. i am
sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. before you say ""no way!"" please read this program carefully. this
is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
opportunity. basically, this is what you do:  as with all
multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new
partners and selling our products. every state in the usa allows
you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a
product for every dollar sent. your orders come by mail and are
filled by e-mail, so you are not involved in personal selling. you
do it privately in your own home, store, or office. this is the greatest multi-level mail order marketing anywhere:
this is what you must do. 1. order all 5 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell
them if you don't have them). * for each report, send $5.00 cash, the name & number of the
report you are ordering, your e-mail address, and your name &
return address (in case of a problem). *make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of
any mail problems! * when you place your order, make sure you order each of the five
reports. you need all five reports so that you can save them on
your computer and resell them. * within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five
reports. save them on your computer so they will be accessible for
you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. 2. important- do not alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their order
on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a""
through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.
once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it
doesn't work if you change it. remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. a. look below for the listing of available reports. b. after you've ordered the. five reports, take this advertisement
and remove the name and address under report #5. this person has
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000! c. move the name and address under report #4 down to report #5. d. move the name and address under report #3 down to report #4. e. move the name and address under report #2 down to report #3 f. move the name and address under report #1 down to report #2. g. insert your name and address in the report #1 position. please make sure you copy every name and address accurately! copy
and paste method works well,.3. take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,
and save it to your computer. make no changes to the instruction
portion of this letter. your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
you can afford $25). you obviously already have an internet
connection and e-mail is free! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find
thousands of free classified ads and much, much more. here are two primary methods of building your downline: method #1: sending bulk e-mail let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000
programs each. let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%
response. using a good list, the response could be much better.
also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs
instead of 2,000. but continuing with this example, you send out
only 2,000 programs. with a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders
for report #1. those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000
programs each for a total of 20,000. out of those 0.5%, 100 people
respond and order report #2. those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. the
0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for report #3. those 1,000
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. the 0.5%
response to that is i 0,000 orders for report #4. that amounts to
10,000 each of $5 bills for you in cash money! then think about
level five!  that's $500,000 alone!your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000
+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!! remember friend, this is assuming 1,990 out of the 2,000 people
you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program!
dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone, or half
sent out 100,000 programs instead of 2,000. believe me, many
people will do just that and more! report #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and
e-mail software. method #2 - placing free ads on the internet 1. advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive, and there are
hundreds of free places to advertise. let's say you decide to
start small just to see how well it works. assume your goal is to
get only 10 people to participate on your first level. placing a
lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response.
also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10
downline members. follow this example to achieve the staggering
results below: 1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50

5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000this totals     -      $555,550 remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each. think for a moment what would happen
if they got 20 people to participate! most people get 100's of
participants. think about it! for every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is
e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it! always provide
same-day service on all orders! this will guarantee that the
e-mail they send out with your name and address on it will be
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report! available reports         *** order each report by number, and
name *** * always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not
accepted * - always send your order via first class mail - make
sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets
of paper (so that the bill can't be seen against light)  on one of
those sheets of paper include: 
(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering,
(b) your e-mail address, and 
(c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider
encounters problems). place your order for these reports now: report #1 ""the insiders guide to advertizing for free on the
internet"" order report #1 from:

about 50,000 new people get online every month! ******* tips for success ******* * treat this as your business! be prompt, professional, and follow
the directions accurately. * send for the five reports immediately so you will have them when
the orders start coming in. when you receive a $5 order, you must
send out the requested product/report. * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive. * be patient and persistent with this program. if you follow the
instructions exactly, your results will be successful! * above all, have faith in yourself and know you will succeed! ******* your success guidelines ******* follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! by the
time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your
mailbox! for now, something simple, such as posting on message
boards something to the effect of ""would you like to know how to
earn $50,000 working out of your house with no initial investment?
email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. and, when
they email you, send them this report in response! if you don't receive 20 orders for report #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100
orders for report#2. if you don't, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you do. once you have received 100 or more orders
for report #2, you can relax, because the system is already
working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! this is important to remember: every time your name is moved down
on the list you are placed in front of a different report. you can
keep track of your progress by watching which report people are
ordering from you. if you want to generate more income, send
another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the
whole process again! there is no limit to the income you will
generate from this business! before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate
in this program, answer one question ...
do you want to change your life? if the answer is yes, please look
at the following facts about this program: 1. you are selling a product which does not cost anything to
produce! 2. you are selling a product which does not cost anything to ship! 3. you are selling a product which does not cost you anything to
advertise! 4. you are utilizing the power of the internet and the power of
multi-level marketing to distribute your product all over the
world! 5. your only expenses other than your initial $25 investment is
your time! 6. virtually all of the income you generate from this program is
pure profit! 7. this program will change your life forever. ******* testimonials******* this program does work, but you must follow it exactly! especially
the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position,
it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. i'm
living proof that it works. it really is a great opportunity to
make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. if you do
choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be
on your way to financial security. -steven bardfield, portland, or my name is mitchell.  my wife, jody, and i live in chicago, il. i
am a cost accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make
pretty good money. when i received the program i grumbled to jody
about receiving ""junk mail."" i made fun of the whole thing,
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.
i 'knew' it wouldn't work. jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. i made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old 'i told you so' on her when the
thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! within two weeks
she had received over 50 responses. within 45 days she had
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! i was shocked! i was sure that
i had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. i am a believer
now. i have joined jody in her ""hobby. "" i did have seven more
years until retirement, but i think of the 'rat race,' and it's
not for me. we owe it all to mlm. -mitchell wolf md., chicago, il. the. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
get a large amount of money in a short time. i was approached
several times before 1 checked this out. i joined just to see what
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required. to my astonishment i received $36,470.00 in the first 14
weeks, with money still coming in. 
-charles morris, esq. not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan. but conservative that i am, i
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
just no way that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my
money back. boy, was i surprised when i found my medium- size post
office box crammed with orders! for awhile, it got so overloaded
that i had to start picking up my mail at the window. i'll make
more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. the nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live.
there simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. 
-paige willis, des moines, ia i had received this program before. i deleted it, but later i
wondered if i shouldn't have given it a try. of course, i had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so i had to wait until i
was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ...
i didn't delete this one! ... i made. more than $41,000 on the
first try!!  -violet wilson, johnstown, pa this is my third time to participate in this plan. we have quit
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the
interest on our money. the only way on earth that this plan will
work for you is if you do it. for your sake, and for your family's
sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. good luck and happy
spending!  -kerry ford, centerport, ny it is up to you now!  take 5 minutes to change your future!order your reports today and get started on your road to financial
freedom! for your information: if you need help with starting a business,
registering a business name, learning how income tax is handled,
etc., contact your local office of the small business
administration (a federal agency) 1(800) 827-5722 for free help
and answers to questions. also, the internal revenue service
offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business
tax requirements. under bill s1618 title hi passed by the 105th us congress this
letter cannot be considered spam as long as the sender includes
contact information and a method of removal. this is a one time
e-mail transmission. no request for removal is necessary  to
remove (even though this is not necessary) press
whenopportunityknocksssss@yahoo.comstop! if you never read another e-mail please take a moment to
read this one.  this really is worth your valuable time.  even if
you never got involved in the program, the reports themselves are
well worth the money.  they can help you start and advertise any
business on the internet.  that is, these reports stand alone and
are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet.at the very least print this out now to read later if you are
pressed for time.

economic recovery committee,
federal secretariat, 
lagos-nigeria.						
for your kind attention,business proposal: transfer of us$ 22.5 m (twenty two
million, five hundred thousand united states dollars)
& business investments partnership.first, i must solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction, this is by  virtue of it's nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret as you were
introduced to us in confidence through the nigerian
chamber of commerce, foreign trade division. i am the chairman of the economic recovery committe
(erc) set up by the present civilian government of
nigeria to review contracts awarded  by the past
military administration.in the course of our work at the erc, we discovered
this fund which resulted from gross re-valuation of
contracts  by top government officials of  the last
administration. the companies that executed the
contracts have been duly paid and the contracts
commissioned leaving the sum of us$22.5 million
floating in the escrow account of the central bank of
nigeria  ready for payment.i have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by
my colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas
partner to whom we could transfer the sum of us$22.5m
legally subcontracting the entitlement to you/your
company. this is bearing in mind that our  civil
service code of conduct forbids us from owning 
foreign company or running  foreign account while in
government service hence the need for an overseas
partner.we have agreed that the funds will be shared thus
after it has been paid into your account:
(1) 25% of the money will go to you for acting as the
beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 5% has been set aside as an abstract projection
for reimbursment to both parties for incidental
expences that may be incurred in the course of the
transaction.
(3) 70% to us the government officials (with  which we
wish to commence an importation business in
conjunction with you ). 
 
all logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction 
within ten to fourteen days of commencement after
receipt of the following information:  your  full
name/ company name, address, company's details &
activities, telephone & fax numbers.these information will enable us make the applications
and lodge claims to the concerned ministries &
agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent
to state here that this transaction is entirely  based
on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque
drawable in any of the central bank of nigeria
correspondent bankers in america, asia and europe is
going to be made in your name.please acknowledge the
receipt of this letter  using my personal e-mail

!==================================================be in good money within a year!!!before 
you say ''bull'', please read the following. this is the letter you have been 
hearing about on the news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on the 
internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the 
investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make 
people money. the show also investigated whether or not the program was 
legal.their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely 
no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some money with only $25 out of 
pocket cost''. due to the recent increase of popularity & respect 
this program has attained,â  it is 
currently working better than ever.this is what one had to say: 
""i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it. i am 
so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. to my astonishment, i received total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" pam hedland, fort

is another testimonial: ""this program has been around for a long time 
but i never believed in it. but one day when i received it again in the mail i 
decided to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the simple instructions and walaa 
.... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. â the first month 
i only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of 
$290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, i have 
made over $710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the key to success in this 
program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything.""more

you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily 
andcomfortably, please read the following...then read it again and 
again!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$follow 
the simple instruction below and your financial dreams will come true, 
guaranteed! instructions:=====order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
=====for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the 
reportyou are ordering and your e-mail address to the person whose name 
appears on that list next to the report. make sure your return address is on 
your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems.=== when 
you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.â  you will need all 5 reports so that you 
can save them on your computer and resell them. your total cost $5 x 
5=$25.00.within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 
reports from these 5 different individuals. save them on your computer so they 
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case 
something happens to your computer.important - do not alter the names of 
the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in 
any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you 
will lose out on a majority of your profits. once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. remember, this 
method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work !!! people have 
tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get 
all the money. but it does not work this way. believe us, we all have tried to 
be greedy and then nothing happened. so do not try to change anything other than 
what is instructed. because if you do, it will not work for you.â  remember, honesty reaps the 
reward!!!1.... after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this 
advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5. 
this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their 
fortune.2.... move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 
5.3.... move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 
4.4.... move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 
3.5.... move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 
26.... insert your name & address in 
the report # 1 position. please 
makesure you copy every name & address 
accurately!==========================================================**** 
take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. do not make any other changes.save this on a disk as well just 
in case if you loose any data. to assist you with marketing your business on the 
internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing 
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find 
thousands of free classified ads and much more. there are 2 primary methods to 
get this venture going:method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail 
legally==========================================================let's 
say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume 
you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. let's also assume that 
the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but 
lets just say it is only 0.2%. also many people will send out hundreds of 
thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).continuing with this example, 
you send out only 5,000 e-mails. with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders 
for report # 1. those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail 
each for a total of 50,000. out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with 
orders. that's=100 people responded and ordered report # 2.those 100 
people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.â  the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders 
for report # 3.those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total 
of 5 million e-mails sent out. the 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for 
report # 4.those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total 
of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
for report #5 that's 100,000 orders times $5 each=$500,000.00 (half 
million).your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000â  
grand total=$555,550.00numbers do not lie. get a 
pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how 
you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money 
!=========================================================remember 
friends, this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5,000 you mailed 
to.â  dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mails each or more? there are over 150 million people on the internet 
worldwide and counting. believe me, many people will do just that, and 
more!method #2: by placing free ads on the 
internet=======================================================advertising 
on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to 
advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger 
response. we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as 
you go along. for every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the 
report they ordered. that's it. always provide same day service on all orders. 
this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on 
it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the 
report.=========== available reports ====================order each 
report by its number & name only. notes: always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) 
for each report. checks not accepted. make sure the cash is concealed by 
wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. on one of those sheets of paper, 
write the number & the name of the report you are ordering, your e-mail 
address and your name and postal address.place your order for these 
reports now!!====================================================

$$$$$$$$$ your success 
guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$follow these guidelines to guarantee 
your success:=== if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 
within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.=== after you have 
received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or 
more for report # 2. if you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails 
until you do.=== once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 
2, you can relax, because the system is already working for you, and the cash 
will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember: every time your name 
is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different 
report.you can keep track of your progress by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. if you want to generate more income send another 
batch of e-mails and start the whole process again.â  there is no limit to the income you can 
generate from this business 
!!!======================================================following 
is a note from the originator of this program: you have just received 
information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with 
no risk and just a little bit of effort. you can make more money in the next few 
weeks and months than you have ever imagined. follow the program exactly as 
instructed. do not change it in any way. it works exceedingly well as it is 
now.remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as 
instructed above. one of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or 
more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.â  remember though, the more you send out 
the more potential customers you will reach. so my friend, i have given you the 
ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. 
it is up to you now !============ more testimonials 
================""my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in 
chicago. i am an accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make pretty good 
money. when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving ''junk 
mail''. i made fun of the whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. i ''knew'' it wouldn't work. jody totally ignored my 
supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. i made 
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''i told you so'' on her when 
the thing didn't work. well, the laugh was on me! within 3 weeks she had 
received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she had received total $ 
147,200.00 ........... all cash! i was shocked. i have joined jody in her 
''hobby''.â  mitchell wolf m.d., 
chicago, 
illinois======================================================''not 
being the gambling type, it took several weeks to make up my mind to participate 
in this plan. but conservative that i am, i decided that the initial investment 
was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn't get enough orders to at 
least get my money back''. '' i was surprised when i found my medium size post 
office box crammed with orders. i made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. the 
nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. there 
simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""â  dan sondstrom, alberta, 
canada=======================================================''i 
had received this program before. i deleted it, but later i wondered if i should 
have given it a try. of course, i had no idea who to contact to get another 
copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 
months passed then it luckily came again...... i did not delete this one! i made 
more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""â  susan de suza, new york, 
n.y.=======================================================''it 
really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to 
you. i followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money 
started to come in. my first month i made $20,560.00 and by the end of third 
month my total cash count was $362,840.00. life is beautiful, thanx to 
internet."".â  fred dellaca, westport,

attention president/c.e.o
                   
dear sir,request for urgent business relationship.firstly i must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. this is by virtue of its nature as 
being utterly confidential and top secret. a member of the nigeria export promotion council 
(n.e.p.c.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade 
exhibition gave your particulars to me. i have decided to seek a confidential operation with 
you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and 
hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.within the ministry of petroleum resources where i work as a director of engineering and 
projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our 
control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling thirty one million united states dollars, 
which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a 
foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual 
account to receive the funds.the source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in nigeria 
which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded 
themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  the 
present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors 
and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we 
have identified floating at the central bank of nigeria ready for payment.  however by virtue 
of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  i was 
therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas 
partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  us$31,000,000.00 (thirty 
one million united states dollars) hence we are writing you this letter. the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed 
so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government 
financial agencies.  we have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation 
of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (f.m.f) and the central bank of nigeria 
(c.b.n).  we are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or 
any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main 
partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  this we can do by swapping of 
account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for 
payment.  by this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, 
and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  this process 
would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.i have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist 
us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 
million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for 
taxation and miscellaneous expenses.the business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.  also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful 
execution of this transaction.  i have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will 
not disappoint me. i will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your 
knowledge when i have heard from you.thanks for your co-operation,yours faithfully,dr. kataga bakorinb: please respond by sending a facsimile (fax) to  my direct confidential  fax no: 234 1

i am hajiya maryam abacha, wife of the late nigeria head of state,general sanni abacha who died on the 8th of june, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship. i currently have within my reach the sum of thirty five million us dollars (us$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like real estate development or import/export business specifically in your country. this money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a russian firm on our countries multi-billion dollars ajaokuta steel plant project. the russian partners returned my husband's share of usd$35,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director right now, the new civilian government have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. in view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the us$3!
 5,000,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited in another private security company vault within the country. i have since declared the security company bankrupt. no record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the russian. due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. let me refer you to the front page of this day newspapers of 10th march 2001. you can check it through their website : www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th. june, 2001) the present government in nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in nigeria and abroad. thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l proposed a percentage of 3!
 0% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 10
% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this transaction. your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. all correspondence must be by the email address above. l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while await your prompt response. nb: because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l have decided that this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy, remember to include your private telephone or fax number for easy communication. you can also contact my trusted friend and family attorney,barrister aishat gidado at aishatgidado@go.com or her number 248033044180.

union bank of nigeria,
 
lagos-nigeria.
 
 
 
attn: the president/c.e.o
 
strictly a private business proposal
 
 
 
dear sir,
 
i am mr. kenneth uba, the manager bills and exchange
at the foreign remittance department of the union bank of nigeria plc. 
 
i am writing this letter to ask for your support and
cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. 
 
we discovered an abandoned sum of $31,000,000.00 (thirty one million united states dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two children in november 1997 in a plane crash.
  
since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as
the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund. 
 
upon this discovery, i and other officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed fund.
 
we have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus; 
20 % for you as foreign partner, 75 % for us the officials in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us and you during the course of this business.
 upon the successful completion of this transfer, i and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. it is from our 75 % we intend to import agricultural machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund.  to commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and your designated
bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.note also, this transaction must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature. 
 
i look forward to receiving your prompt response.

            is legal, and online contest sponsors have confirmed that it doesn't
            violate their rules. so if you win a prize, you'll receive it.

hello, 
premium phone qualified 
business opportunity leads
if you're spending money marketing a business opportunity or mlm,
you will definitely be interested in 
what we have to offer you. 
you're tired of blindly spending money for leads and not having 
any idea what kind of response you'll get from it.â  sometimes
calling 100 people without one single signup!â  sometimes 
talking to people who have been bombarded by bizop pitches
to the point of them hanging up when you call!â  (leads oversold)
we're here to help! 
we'll get you qualified leads for your mlm or business opportunity. 
period. 
no qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense. 
we'll do it quickly, and professionally. 
and we won't ask you for a single dime without guaranteeing results!here's how we generate our leads...
- all of these leads are generated in-house!
- one source we use for lead-generation is a business opportunity
seeker lead list of people who have requested info. about making 
extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,
or responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.
- the other source we use is an automated call center.
we have computerized software that dials up local residents,
plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in
making money from home.â  if they are, the system records their
name and phone number for us to call back and qualify.
- the prospects that come from either of the above sources are then
phone interviewed by us, here in our offices and the following 
info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):
name:
email:
phone:
best time to call:
state:
reason they want to work from home!:
how much they want to make per month:
how much time they can commit per week:
how much money they have available for startup:
if they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:
we'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no
more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.
- then the leads are submitted to a website we set up for you, 
from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.
- this way, you get the leads fresh, and in *real-time* 
(only minutes old).â  never more than 24 hours old.â  guaranteed!
- we guarantee that you'll receive at least a valid name, 
phone number and the time-date stamp corresponding to when
the lead was generated!â  however, almost all leads will have
all of the information asked above.benefits of our phone qualified lead generation system:
1. they will be extremely qualified due to the nature of the 
qualifying questions that will be asked (above).
2. they are super-fresh!â  delivered in real-time only moments 
after they are contacted and qualified!â  (not 30-120 days old)
3. they're targeted.â  each lead we generate originates from a
targeted list of business opportunity seekers.
4. they're highly receptive!â  receptivity is very, very high 
because they aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching 
them on opportunities!â  also they'll remember speaking to 
someone over the phone.â  especially since we tell them to 
expect your call!
5. no ""feast or famine"" activity.â  leads will be coming in 
regularly.â  you dictate the flow!
6. no more cold calls!â  we tell your prospects you'll be calling.
7. you can *personalize* your approach with the info. you 
get with each lead!
8. save time.â  naturally, better leads means less calls to get a sale.
9. lower ""burnout"" factor.â  calling red-hot leads makes it easier 
to pick up the phone, day in and day out.
10. you can sort your leads based on their responses and call the
hottest ones first.
11. you can get new reps started quicker using these leads due 
to higher closing ratios.â  of course, this builds faster and stronger 
momentum, and skyrockets ""new rep retention"" as a result of 
""quick successes"".
12. the leads will be uniform - almost all leads will have the info. 
indicated above. (all leads will have valid phone numbers.)
13. they're double-qualified because to generate the lead, 
a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.
14. excellent control of the flow of leads coming through.
if you've been trying to run things too long without a steady flow of high
quality leads, call us now to get things in motion.â  just let us know 
what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized 
lead-generation campaign for you. 
since your need to get business moving has probably never been 
more critical than it is today, why not call us now!
these are fresh, highly qualified leads because these people aren't 
just responding to some ""generic business opportunity"" ad, they're 
contacted over the phone specifically for your company!â  and we 
forward you the leads within minutes of the lead being generated - not 
days, weeks, or months!start generating as many sign-ups as you can handle!
explode your downline and income!
call for details and discount pricing!

chamber of commerce and industry handed me your contact for a 
confidential business. i am an officer with the united bank for africa plc (uba),ilupeju branch,
lagos nigeria.the intended business is thus; we had a customer, a foreigner (a 
turkish)resident in nigeria, he was a contractor with one of the government parastatals. he has in his account in my branch the sum of us$35 million(thirty five million u.s. dollars).
 
unfortunately, the man died four years ago until today non-of his next
of kin has come forward to claim the money. 
having noticed this, i in collaboration with two other top officials
of the bank we have covered up the account all this while.  
 now we want you (being a foreigner) to be fronted as one of his next
of kin and forward your account and other relevant documents to be 
advised to you by us to attest to the claim. we will use our positions to get all internal documentations to back
up the claims .the whole procedures will last only ten working days to
get the fund retrieved successfully without trace even in future.
 
your response is only what we are waiting for as we have arranged all
necessary things  as soon as this message comes to you kindly get back to me indicating your interest ,then i will furnish you with the whole procedures to ensure that the deal is successfully concluded for your assistance we have agreed to give you thirty percent (30%) of
the total sum at the end of the transaction. it is risk free and a mega
fortune. 
all correspondence towards this transaction will be through the e-mail

exactly how & where to get grants. this money has to
be given away, why not to you?
you may be thinking, ""how

impossible! it's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
united states are receiving millions of dollars from these government and
private foundation's everyday.

this money is not a loan,
trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
these government agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.
you decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the government
agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
this money is non taxable & interest free.
none of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and u.s. citizen are entitled to this money.
there are currently over
1,400 federal programs, 24,000 state programs, 30,000 private foundations

fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
in
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
most
people never apply for free business grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.the fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive free grants money and other benefits from the government, and you

become millionaires everyday through multi-level marketing.you may have heard this story before, but donald trump made an
appearance on the david letterman show. dave asked him what he
would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch.
without hesitating trump said he would find a good network
marketing company and get to work.
the audience, started to hoot and boo him. he looked out at the
audience and dead-panned his response. ""that's why i'm sitting up
here and you are all sitting out there!""with network marketing you have two sources of income. direct
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from
sales made by people you introduce to the business.residual income is the secret of the wealthy. it means investing
time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again.
in network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of
others.the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my
fingers. fortunately, sometime later i reread everything and gave
some thought and study to it.my name is jonathan rourke. two years ago, the corporation i
worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position
was eliminated. after unproductive job interviews, i decided to
open my own business. over the past year, i incurred many
unforeseen financial problems. i owed my family, friends and
creditors over $35,000. the economy was taking a toll on my
business and i just couldn't seem to make ends meet. i had to
refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and
struggling business. at that moment something significant happened
in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that
this will change your life forever financially!!!in mid december, i received this program via e-mail. six month's
prior to receiving this program, i had been sending away for
information on various business opportunities. all of the programs
i received, in my opinion were not cost effective. they were
either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial
investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work
or not. one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one
year. it didn't tell me i'd have to write a book to make it!but like i was saying, in december i received this program. i
didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a
mailing list. thank goodness for that!!!
after reading it several times, to make sure i was reading it
correctly, i couldn't believe my eyes.here was a money making phenomenon.i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me
further into debt. after i got a pencil and paper and figured it
out, i would at least get my money back. but like most of you i
was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal
aspects of it all. so i checked it out with the u.s. post office
(1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed
legal! after determining the program was legal and not a chain
letter, i decided ""why not.""initially i sent out 10,000 e-mails. it cost me about $15 for my
time on-line. the great thing about e-mail is that i don't need
any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of
my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. i am
telling you like it is. i hope it doesn't turn you off, but i
promised myself that i would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how
much money it cost me.
here is the basic version of what you need to do:your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report #1
within 2 weeks of your first program going out. if you don't, send
out more programs until you do.your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for report #2
within 4 weeks. if not, send out more programs until you do.once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. you
will make $50,000+ but keep at it! if you don't get 150 right off,
keep at it! it may take some time for your down line to build.
keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted.in less than one week, i was starting to receive orders for report
#1. i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13,
1 had received 26 orders for report #1. my first step in making
$50,000 in 90 days was done.by january 30, 1 had received 196 orders for report #2; 46 more
than i needed. so i sat back and relaxed. by march 1, of my
e-mailing of 10,000, i received $58,000 with more coming in every
day. i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car.
please take time to read the attached program, it will change your
life forever!!  remember, it won't work if you don't try it. this
program does work, but you must follow it exactly! especially the
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. it
won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money!in order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal
of 20+ orders for report #1, and 150+ orders for report #2 and you
will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. if you don't reach the first
two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of
money, it may take a few months or so longer. but keep mailing out
the programs and stay focused! that's the key.  i am living proof
that it works!!! if you choose not to participate in this program,
i am sorry. it really is a great opportunity with little cost or
risk to you. if you choose to participate, follow the program and
you will be on your way to financial security.if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble
like i was, or you want to start your own business, consider this
a sign. i did!  -sincerely,  jonathan rourkep.s.  do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look
like piled up on a kitchen table? it's awesome!a personal note from the originator of this program:by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you
should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal,
could not have been created by an amateur.let me tell you a little about myself. i had a profitable business
for 10 years. then in 1979 my business began falling off. i was
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but
it wasn't working.finally, i figured it out. it wasn't me; it was the economy.
inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had
been with us since 1945.i don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment
rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. there
were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.the middle class was vanishing. those who knew what they were
doing invested wisely and moved up. those who did not including
those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down
into the ranks of the poor.as the saying goes, 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.""
the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to
""move up"" or ""get rich"". inflation will see to that.you have just received information that can give you financial
freedom for the rest of your life, with ""no risk"" and ""just a
little bit of effort."" you can make more money in the next few
months than you have ever imagined.follow the program exactly as instructed. do not change it in any
way. it works exceedingly well as it is now. remember to e-mail a
copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. one of
the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name
will be on everyone of them!remember though, the more you send out the more potential
customers you will reach.so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.  it is up to
you now!""think about it."" before you delete this program from your
mailbox, as i almost did, take a little time to read it and really
think about it. get a pencil and figure out what could happen when
you participate. figure out the worst possible response and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!
you will definitely get back what you invested. any doubts you
have will vanish when your first orders come in. it works! -jody
jacobs, richmond, vahere's how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar$this method of raising capital really works 100% every time. i am
sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.before you say ""no way!"" please read this program carefully. this
is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
opportunity. basically, this is what you do:  as with all
multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new
partners and selling our products. every state in the usa allows
you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a
product for every dollar sent. your orders come by mail and are
filled by e-mail, so you are not involved in personal selling. you
do it privately in your own home, store, or office.this is the greatest multi-level mail order marketing anywhere:
this is what you must do.1. order all 5 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell
them if you don't have them).* for each report, send $5.00 cash, the name & number of the
report you are ordering, your e-mail address, and your name &
return address (in case of a problem).*make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of
any mail problems!* when you place your order, make sure you order each of the five
reports. you need all five reports so that you can save them on
your computer and resell them.* within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five
reports. save them on your computer so they will be accessible for
you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.2. important- do not alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their order
on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a""
through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.
once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it
doesn't work if you change it. remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.a. look below for the listing of available reports.b. after you've ordered the. five reports, take this advertisement
and remove the name and address under report #5. this person has
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!c. move the name and address under report #4 down to report #5.d. move the name and address under report #3 down to report #4.e. move the name and address under report #2 down to report #3f. move the name and address under report #1 down to report #2.g. insert your name and address in the report #1 position.please make sure you copy every name and address accurately! copy
and paste method works well,.3. take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,
and save it to your computer. make no changes to the instruction
portion of this letter.your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
you can afford $25). you obviously already have an internet
connection and e-mail is free!to assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find
thousands of free classified ads and much, much more.here are two primary methods of building your downline:method #1: sending bulk e-maillet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000
programs each. let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%
response. using a good list, the response could be much better.
also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs
instead of 2,000. but continuing with this example, you send out
only 2,000 programs. with a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders
for report #1. those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000
programs each for a total of 20,000. out of those 0.5%, 100 people
respond and order report #2.those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. the
0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for report #3. those 1,000
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. the 0.5%
response to that is i 0,000 orders for report #4. that amounts to
10,000 each of $5 bills for you in cash money! then think about
level five!  that's $500,000 alone!your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000
+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!!remember friend, this is assuming 1,990 out of the 2,000 people
you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program!
dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone, or half
sent out 100,000 programs instead of 2,000. believe me, many
people will do just that and more!report #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and
e-mail software.method #2 - placing free ads on the internet1. advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive, and there are
hundreds of free places to advertise. let's say you decide to
start small just to see how well it works. assume your goal is to
get only 10 people to participate on your first level. placing a
lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response.
also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10
downline members. follow this example to achieve the staggering
results below:1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50
2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500
3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000
4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000
5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000this totals     -      $555,550remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each. think for a moment what would happen
if they got 20 people to participate! most people get 100's of
participants.think about it! for every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is
e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it! always provide
same-day service on all orders! this will guarantee that the
e-mail they send out with your name and address on it will be
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!available reports         *** order each report by number, and
name **** always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not
accepted * - always send your order via first class mail - make
sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets
of paper (so that the bill can't be seen against light)  on one of
those sheets of paper include:
(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering,
(b) your e-mail address, and
(c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider
encounters problems).place your order for these reports now:report #1 ""the insiders guide to advertising for free on the internet""order report #1 from:tony goon

the directions accurately.* send for the five reports immediately so you will have them when
the orders start coming in. when you receive a $5 order, you must
send out the requested product/report.* always provide same-day service on the orders you receive.* be patient and persistent with this program. if you follow the
instructions exactly, your results will be successful!* above all, have faith in yourself and know you will succeed!******* your success guidelines *******follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! by the
time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your
mailbox! for now, something simple, such as posting on message
boards something to the effect of ""would you like to know how to
earn $50,000 working out of your house with no initial investment?
email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. and, when
they email you, send them this report in response!if you don't receive 20 orders for report #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100
orders for report#2. if you don't, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you do. once you have received 100 or more orders
for report #2, you can relax, because the system is already
working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!this is important to remember: every time your name is moved down
on the list you are placed in front of a different report. you can
keep track of your progress by watching which report people are
ordering from you. if you want to generate more income, send
another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the
whole process again! there is no limit to the income you will
generate from this business!before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate
in this program, answer one question ...
do you want to change your life? if the answer is yes, please look
at the following facts about this program:1. you are selling a product which does not cost anything to
produce!2. you are selling a product which does not cost anything to ship!3. you are selling a product which does not cost you anything to
advertise!4. you are utilizing the power of the internet and the power of
multi-level marketing to distribute your product all over the
world!5. your only expenses other than your initial $25 investment is
your time!6. virtually all of the income you generate from this program is
pure profit!7. this program will change your life forever.******* testimonials*******this program does work, but you must follow it exactly! especially
the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position,
it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. i'm
living proof that it works. it really is a great opportunity to
make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. if you do
choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be
on your way to financial security. -steven bardfield, portland, ormy name is mitchell.  my wife, jody, and i live in chicago, il. i
am a cost accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make
pretty good money. when i received the program i grumbled to jody
about receiving ""junk mail."" i made fun of the whole thing,
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.
i 'knew' it wouldn't work. jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. i made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old 'i told you so' on her when the
thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! within two weeks
she had received over 50 responses. within 45 days she had
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! i was shocked! i was sure that
i had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. i am a believer
now. i have joined jody in her ""hobby. "" i did have seven more
years until retirement, but i think of the 'rat race,' and it's
not for me. we owe it all to mlm. -mitchell wolf md., chicago, il.the. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
get a large amount of money in a short time. i was approached
several times before 1 checked this out. i joined just to see what
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required. to my astonishment i received $36,470.00 in the first 14
weeks, with money still coming in.
-charles morris, esq.not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan. but conservative that i am, i
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
just no way that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my
money back. boy, was i surprised when i found my medium- size post
office box crammed with orders! for awhile, it got so overloaded
that i had to start picking up my mail at the window. i'll make
more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. the nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live.
there simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
-paige willis, des moines, iai had received this program before. i deleted it, but later i
wondered if i shouldn't have given it a try. of course, i had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so i had to wait until i
was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ...
i didn't delete this one! ... i made. more than $41,000 on the
first try!!  -violet wilson, johnstown, pathis is my third time to participate in this plan. we have quit
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the
interest on our money. the only way on earth that this plan will
work for you is if you do it. for your sake, and for your family's
sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. good luck and happy
spending!  -kerry ford, centerport, nyit is up to you now!  take 5 minutes to change your future!order your reports today and get started on your road to financial

somatotropin 
                    (aka growth factor, hgh, hgh, growth hormone, gh, human growth 
                    hormone) is naturally produced by the anterior pituitary gland 
                    in the brain and declines with age, so it is a natural substance 
                    already in your body right this moment. hgh is known as the 
                    master hormone because it exerts effects over all other hormones 
                    in the body, including testosterone, estrogen, progesterone 
                    and dhea. augmenting declining somatotropin levels by giving 
                    your body daily ingestible somatotropin, can create a more 
                    youthful hormone balance that results in dramatic improvements 
                    in your health.
                    â  somatotropin supplementation 
                    is a life-enhancement. lives that were once shattered by fatigue, 
                    illness or the ravages of aging, now fourish with the help 
                    of somatotropin supplementation.
                    â  somatotropin from the pituitary 
                    works by stimulating protein production in all tissues of 
                    the body. this results in an increase in organ healing and 
                    regeneration, which is associated with increase resistance 
                    to illness and injury.
no matter your age, we guarantee
                    you will look and feel better than

1,"hi,i'm a college dropout.  i work about two hours a day.  
i'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and i make over 
$250,000 a year.  are you curious yet?in a minute i'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the internet ...you've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.well, grasshopper, think again ...it's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  yep, people like you and me!ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with no investment and very little 
work.  how?  by learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called bulk email, or spam.if you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  i bet you can't click on 
delete fast enough for most of those ads, right?
you might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the internet.  i 
guarantee it.  now let's go back to math 101 and 
review some numbers ...if you sell on ebay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  how many people see your ad?  maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  using bulk email, you can
send your ad to more than a million people a day
at virtually no cost.  whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
zero!stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  if you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  it's that simple ...all you have to do is convince one person out of a
thousand to buy your stuff and you're filthy rich.the best thing is that anyone can do it.  doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in new 
york city.  anyone, and i repeat anyone, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  all it takes 
is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some 
basic familiarity with the internet.i quit college when i was 19 to capitalize on the 
""dot com"" mania, and i've never looked back.  i 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  i saw an 
opportunity and i seized it.  a few years later, 
i bought my own home - with cash.  you don't need any money.  you don't need a product.
you don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  if you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  it would be a dream come true.
so what are you waiting for?!i'm going to ask you four simple questions.  if you answer
yes to all of them, then i can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.here goes ...do you have basic experience with the web? 
do you have a computer and an internet connection?
do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  if you answer yes to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!all you need is ambition and commitment.  this
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  you have to work
to make big bucks, but anyone - and i mean anyone - can do 
it.you're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
don't worry, it's not! i will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  you'll be generating 
orders - and making money - in less than seven days.okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?no problem!!  i'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like craaaaaazy! most people delay
starting an internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but i'm removing that hurdle right now.  
after reading the spambook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  there is no excuse 
not to get started! i will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. in fact ...i personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the spambook!  i'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!i will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""seven days to 
bulk email success"".  this seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  on day one, for 
example, i teach you where to find a product to sell. 
the next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  on the seventh day, you just click send!  your 
very first campaign is ready to go.as a special bonus, you'll recieve a free copy 
of our stealth mass mailer, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! i'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely free
if you order now!stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  if you are serious about making money 
on the internet, bulk email is your only option.  
what are you waiting for?  few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but i promise to teach 
you everything i know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... the spambook! once again, here's the deal.  you give me $29.99.  
i give you all the tools you need to become a
successful, high profit email bulk emailer.  including:** the spambook

head of state, general sani abacha who died on 
the 8th
of june 1998 while still on active duty. i am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.i currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million united states dollars 
(us$36,000,000) in
cash, which i intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. this money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a russian firm on our country's
multi-billion dollars ajaokuta steel plant. the
russian partners returned my husbands share of
us$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in nigeria of 
which i
am a director. right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
in view
of this, i acted very fast to withdraw the
us$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.no record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the russians.due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus i seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. on your consent, i 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, i propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services

assistance. your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent

trying almost everything to lose weight.â  i know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds i needed to lose
either.â  it seemed like the harder i worked at it, the less
weight i lost - until i heard about 'extreme power plus'.you're probably thinking to yourself, ""oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""â  like you, i was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so i told her i'd give it a try.â  i mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!â  let me tell you, it was
the best decision i've ever made.  period.  six months later,
as i'm writing this message to you, i've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and i haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.â  yes, i still eat pizza, and lots of it!i was so happy with the results that i contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a huge discount.â i feel
the need to help other people lose weight like i did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
i am giving you my personal pledge that 'extreme power plus'
absolutely will work for you. 100 % money-back guaranteed!if you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then i recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'extreme power plus'!you're probably asking yourself, ""ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""extreme power plus contains lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. no ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just results!!! here is the bottom line ...i can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.â  
just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!â  you will lose weight fast - guaranteed.â  this is my
pledge to you.bonus! order now & get free shipping on 3 bottles or more!â  to order extreme power plus on our secure server, just click

president of zaire (president mobutu sese seko)
since the death of my late father some years ago i have
been residing in south africa on temporary political asylum. on my arrivalin south africa after my late father's burial, i came in with a diplomatic
packaged consignment containing the sum of $8,000,000.00 (eight million united states dollars) which i got from part of the money my late father made through diamonds sales when he was the president of zaire for about 32 years.precisely, since my arrival with the diplomatic packaged consignment it has been safely kept with a security company here in south africa.
i do not want to invest this money in any part of
africa due to the constant political instability in
africa.my plan is to use this money to invest in a
profitable business in any part of the world apart
from africa, also to purchase a residential
accommodation. i will come over and settle there
with my family. hence,i am soliciting for your
assistance as my foreign partner to receive this
money on my behalf on arrival abroad and to keep it
in a safe place pending my arrival to join you up.
upon the receipt of your acceptance to my proposal, i can immediately arrange for the money to leave nigeria in your favour (i.e. as the beneficiary) for onward
movement to where you can receive the consignment.
please if you are willing to assist me, do send in
your reply immediately based on the following: -1) the percentage of this amount which you intend
to charge for your assistance, please feel free to
express your mind,
(2) include your private telephone and fax numbers
to enhance the confidentiality,which this business
demands.
i shall inform you on the next line of action as
soon as i receive your positive response. 10% of the total money will be set aside for any extra expenditure. i assure you that this deal is 100% risk
free as long as we keep it to ourselves.
your urgent response through my e-mail shall be
highly appreciated.best regards,tamko mobutu.--deathtospamdeathtospamdeathtospam--

â "" qualify for at least $25,000 in free
grants money - guaranteed! ""each day over one million dollars in free
government
grantsâ  is given away to people just like you for a wide
variety of business and personal needs
â â â â â â â 
dear grant seeker,
in a moment, i'll tell you
exactly how & where to get grants. this money has to
be given away, why not to you?
you may be thinking, ""how
can i get some of this free grants money""
maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?
let me tell you it's not
impossible! it's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
united states are receiving millions of dollars from these government and
private foundation's everyday.
who can apply?
anyone can apply
for a grant from 18 years old and up!
grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! grants don't have to be paid back,
ever! claim
your slice of the free american pie.
this money is not a loan,
trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
these government agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.
you decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the government
agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
this money is non taxable & interest free.
none of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and u.s. citizen are entitled to this money.
there are currently over
1,400 federal programs, 24,000 state programs, 30,000 private foundations
and 20,000 scholarship programs available.
this year over $30 billion
dollars in free personal and business government grants money will be given
away by government grants agencies.
â government personal
and business grants facts:
over 20 million people get government
money every year:
1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money
to start or expand a business
4,000,000 people get money to invest
in real estate
6,000,000 people get money to go
to college
10,000,000 people get free help and
training for a better job
getting business
grants
anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where free business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the federal
government.
it
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the united
states of america wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in free
consulting and research grants.
with an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
in
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
most
people never apply for free business grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.the fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive free grants money and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.government grants

low income families, repair your home, rent, mortgage payments, utility
bills, purchase a new car, groceries, childcare, fuel, general living expenses,

once you know how and where
to apply for a specific free grant, results are almost inevitable. the
government wants to give away this money. . . it is under congressional
mandate to do so! these funds are made available to help you, the tax payer.

1,"long time no chat!how have you been? if you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost everything to lose weight.â  i know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds i needed to lose
either.â  it seemed like the harder i worked at it, the less
weight i lost - until i heard about 'extreme power plus'.you're probably thinking to yourself, ""oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""â  like you, i was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so i told her i'd give it a try.â  i mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!â  let me tell you, it was
the best decision i've ever made.  period.  six months later,
as i'm writing this message to you, i've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and i haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.â  yes, i still eat pizza, and lots of it!i was so happy with the results that i contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a huge discount.â i feel
the need to help other people lose weight like i did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
i am giving you my personal pledge that 'extreme power plus'
absolutely will work for you. 100 % money-back guaranteed!if you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then i recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'extreme power plus'!you're probably asking yourself, ""ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""extreme power plus contains lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. no ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just results!!! here is the bottom line ...i can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.â  
just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!â  you will lose weight fast - guaranteed.â  this is my
pledge to you.bonus! order now & get free shipping on 3 bottles or more!â  to order extreme power plus on our secure server, just click

june 4, 1999- sirs: the following text was located on a site written or
placed by you or under your control:
""dom is located on karitane island and now includes the taongi atoll in
the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the south pacific 1000
miles south of tahiti. however, the marshall islands government has
condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the
dom and sister nation, the kingdom of enenkio (the marshallese name for
wake island), claiming to represent the mid-pacific nation amid an
alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france-
presse. the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to
countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by
representatives of either nation.""
""a honolulu-based attorney created the ""kingdom of enenkio"" in the early
1990s. it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall
islands paramount chief mursel hermios, which granted the attorney broad
powers to act on his behalf. the marshall islands high court has ruled
the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has
disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/two.htm (disconnected as of
2/1/00)
the purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of
false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the kingdom
of enenkio. while i am pleased to find you have apparently taken a
serious interest in the kingdom of enenkio, i am aghast at how
distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. as a consequence of
my service to his majesty king remios and the people of enenkio, i am
obligated to respond to incidents such as this. i will respectfully
offer the following line by line correction. for your convenience, your
text will be set off (with ""**"") in color:
**dom is located on karitane island and now includes the taongi atoll in
the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the south pacific 1000
miles south of tahiti.**
(comment: the construction of this statement implies the marshall
islands are in the south pacific ocean 1000 miles south of tahiti, in
which case a reader may be misled.)
correction: dom is located on karitane island in the south pacific, 1000
miles south of tahiti, and now includes taongi atoll in the northern
atolls of the marshall islands in the north pacific.
**however, the marshall islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent
assertions"" of two organizations, ...**
(comment: just because the rmi government ""...has condemned the
'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...enenkio..."", does that make it true?
why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been
internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud,
abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every
financial obligation it has ever made? what purpose do you propose to
serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for
the very lives of marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign
invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their
own corrupt government?)
**...namely the dom and sister nation, the kingdom of enenkio (the
marshallese name for wake island),...**
(comment: nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for
dom, but as for the kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister
nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is
not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio, it is a
deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, his majesty king remios, the
sovereign of enenkio and eneen-kio atoll, and an inexplicable and
irresponsible abuse of journalism. doesn't anybody check sources
anymore?)
correction: the kingdom of enenkio is an independent sovereign state and
the same could be said for dom.
**...claiming to represent the mid-pacific nation amid an alleged
investment scam according to an article in agence france- presse.**
(comment: the government of the kingdom of enenkio represents the people
of enenkio, who are forced to live in exile from eneen-kio atoll, lands
and seas that played a significant role in marshallese culture for
perhaps 2000 years. furthermore, ""...an article in agence france-presse""
has no merit as it was authored by a source in the marshall islands
government. my preceding comments apply. the kingdom of enenkio is not
now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". we have
tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources
for programs that will not only benefit the people of enenkio, but also
will positively impact people around the globe. in fact, we are
currently working with a former nasa astronaut. one tool scammers have
in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate
entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. many journalists
use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. doesn't
anybody check sources anymore?)
**the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries
against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of
either nation.**
(comment: the kingdom of enenkio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of
which i am aware, and in my post, i am responsible for all published
information. i would personally caution any ""..countries against
acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of...""
nations, companies or publications if i had credible proof to that
effect. however, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any
rmi ministry source. furthermore, the rmi has repeatedly attacked the
credibility of his majesty king hermios, who happens to be the ancestral
sovereign owner under marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the
marshall islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his
will. we believe some officials in the rmi are afraid of what will
happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of
lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and
they no longer have their hands on the till. to perpetrate their
jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.)
**a honolulu-based attorney created the ""kingdom of enenkio"" in the
early 1990s.**
(comment: mr. moore is not an attorney, though he was living in honolulu
in the early 1990s.)
correction: the kingdom of enenkio was established by decree of the
owner of eneen-kio atoll [a.k.a. enen-kio, halcyon, disclerta, wake and
6-8 other names], iroijlaplap murjel hermios, who then was paramount
chief of the northern ratak atolls [he passed away in december 1998] and
was fully recognized by the rmi government. he declared the sovereign
state of enenkio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their king
over eneen-kio atoll, ratified the constitution and established
government as a limited constitutional monarchy.
**it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands
paramount chief mursel (sic) hermios, which granted the attorney broad
powers to act on his behalf.**
correction: the establishment of the kingdom of enenkio was made
possible by murjel's appointment of mr. robert moore, the adopted
brother of hermios, alab of taongi atoll and a private citizen, to the
post of minister plenipotentiary. the document of appointment was also a
special power of attorney which granted mr. moore very specific
instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the united states from
eneen-kio atoll and establish an independent state on hermios' and the
people's behalf.
**the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and
ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.**
(comment: since when is a special power of attorney an ""agreement""? the
marshall islands high court has no record or knowledge of the special
power of attorney, except as has been publicized by the kingdom of
enenkio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over eneen-kio atoll,
which lies over 100 miles north of lawful rmi boundaries. the rmi has no
political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of
eneen-kio atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not
incorporated into the rmi when it formed its government in 1979, nor was
it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of
any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch of eneen-kio and any
statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.)
finally, i suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more
research, not only into establishment and development of the kingdom of
enenkio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent u.s. invasion
of eneen-kio atoll, properly named by 'marshallese' centuries before
arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. then i invite you
to our embassy in honolulu to review the public files and documents
mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace')
and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site.
be sure to view the documents at our resource center which show, in many
cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so
states in the world, many of which are first world. in closing, i would
simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request
the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected
elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above
in the article.

june 3, 1999- sir: the following report was sent to me in which the
author mentions the kingdom of enenkio (thank you for spelling 'enenkio'
correctly. the purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request
for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author
regarding the kingdom of enenkio.
""fantasy island"" -- ""melchizedek passport scam reveals how the internet
can take fraud to new frontiers"" by bertil lintner in bangkok, december
10, 1998: ""determined not to give up, pedley moved his fictional nation
once again, this time to taongi atoll in the western pacific. according
to a melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, taongi was
leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of
enenkio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims
the u.s.-held wake island. in real life, taongi is an uninhabited atoll
in the marshall islands.""
http://www.feer.com/restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article
of december 24, 1998: ""fantasy island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00)
response to the author: i am unable to locate the ""melchizedek press
release"" you cited, indicating that ""...taongi was leased in 1997 under
a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of enenkio,..."". such an
act would be impossible and implausible as enenkio has no legal
authority or political jurisdiction over taongi atoll in the marshall
islands. further more, melchizedek (dom) is not so uninformed as to
publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a
suitable land base for its people to administer their form of
government.
the kingdom of enenkio did enter into a treaty with dom on the 19th day
of september, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. it declared a
state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our
governments. however, a prior agreement, signed in may 1997, which had
nothing to do with the kingdom of enenkio, transferred mr. robert
moore's rights to develop taongi from mr. moore to dom. it did not
convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence.
this was made possible because mr. moore is the alab (one class of
landowner) of taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to
taongi atoll, from the principal landowner, iroijlaplap (paramount
chief) murjel hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction.
consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by
mr. moore, who is also the adopted brother of hermios.
now, please understand, that while mr. moore was acting in the latter
case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of
taongi, which would have generated an income to iroijlaplap hermios, mr.
moore wears another hat as minister plenipotentiary of the kingdom of
enenkio. iroijlaplap hermios, also wore (he died in december 10, 1998,
the same date of your article) other hats: one as first monarch, king of
the kingdom of enenkio and one as owner in allodium of eneen-kio atoll
(a.k.a. enen-kio, halcyon, disclerta, wake and several other names).
for you to state the kingdom of enenkio is ""...another only-in-
cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a
completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign
of ignorance of the state of enenkio. and, it is a blatant deceptive
intrusion upon his majesty king hermios, the sovereign of enenkio and
eneen-kio atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your
journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be
proved accurate.
i suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment
and development of the kingdom of enenkio, but into the prehistoric
history and more recent u.s. invasion of eneen-kio atoll, properly named
by 'marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and
missionaries. then i invite you to our embassy in honolulu to review the
public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and
most of which are referenced or published at our official web address:
be sure to view the documents at our resource center which show, in many
cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so
states in the world, many of which are first world. in closing, i would
simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request
the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be
added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

june 2, 1999- sir: the following statement (in quotes) was copied from
one of your footnotes to history -d and e (disconnected as of 12/1/00).
""enenkio atoll- in 1898, the united states annexed wake island, in the
marshall islands of the western pacific. after the marshalls became a
u.s. trust territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for
recognition that wake island was a part of the marianas chain, and
pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called enenkio locally.
the u.s. government has consistently ignored these claims. the protests
took a sharper turn after the u.s. congress in 1993 acknowledged the
illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by americans of
the republic of hawai'i. king murjel hermios, who is paramount chief of
an archipelago in the northern marshalls, declared wake island's
independence in 1987. the marshalls recognized this claim shortly after
the nation gained its independence. in return for his services as
minister plenipotentiary in the united states, hermios granted american
businessman robert moore land on taongi atoll in the northern marshalls,
which moore has declared the dominion of melchizedek.""
comment: with all candor, i cannot figure how such straight forward
facts such as we have presented to the public and over the internet
since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced
text. while i am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very
serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke,
which i am assuming is not the case) in the history of the kingdom of
enenkio, i am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your
summary is. as a consequence of my service to his majesty king remios
and the people of enenkio, i will respectfully offer the following line
by line correction. for your convenience, your text will be set off
(with ""**"") in color:
**in 1898, the united states annexed wake island, in the marshall
islands of the western pacific.**
correction: in 1898, the united states invaded wake island, the
northernmost atoll -- actually named eneen-kio centuries before western
explorers arrived -- of the ratak chain of marshall islands in
micronesia and the central north pacific ocean.
the author responds: ""rest assured that i did not mean to downplay the
role of violence in the american acquisition of the territory.""
**after the marshalls became a u.s. trust territory, the traditional
chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that wake island was a part
of the marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll,
called enenkio locally.**
correction: following w.w.ii, the trust territories of the pacific,
which included the marshall islands, was placed under administration of
the united states by the united nations. while eneen-kio was well
established as one of the marshalls, the u.s. only knew it as wake and,
having lost many u.s. lives there in 1941 at the hands of japanese
invaders, kept control of it. in 1993, the paramount chief of the ratak
atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands
of eneen-kio atoll.
the author responds: ""i don't see much conflict between the two versions
here.""
**the u.s. government has consistently ignored these claims.**
correction: the u.s. government has consistently ignored claims from the
marshall islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its
move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional
landowners, including iroijlaplap murjel hermios.
the author responds: ""i will note this.""
**the protests took a sharper turn after the u.s. congress in 1993
acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment
by americans of the republic of hawai'i.**
correction: the eneen-kio claims gained some new momentum after
precedents were set by the u.s. congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged
the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the monarch of the kingdom of
hawai'i by a group of american businessmen and u.s. marines, and in the
following year returned the island of kaho'olawe to the hawaiian people.
**king murjel hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the
northern marshalls, declared wake island's independence in 1987.**
correction: king murjel hermios, who was paramount chief until his death
in december 1998, declared the sovereign state of enenkio in 1994,
whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen-kio atoll,
ratified the constitution and established government as a limited
constitutional monarchy.
the author responds: ""i will make the necessary corrections here.""
**the marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained
its independence. in return for his services as minister plenipotentiary
in the united states, hermios granted american businessman robert moore
land on taongi atoll in the northern marshalls, which moore has declared
the dominion of melchizedek.**
correction: after the death of the first monarch, his brother remios
succeeded to the throne as second monarch and rules along with his
brother, crown prince lobadreo, over the kingdom of enenkio today.
to continue the commentary: the parts left out were either wrong or have
nothing to do with the history of the kingdom of enenkio itself. since
hm king remios also succeeded to iroijlaplap of the northern ratak
atolls of the marshall islands, he also has responsibilities over 10
atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. but that is another story,
which has nothing directly to do with the kingdom of enenkio. i have
offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct
your site per my suggestions. please feel free to contact me or view our
pages at the address above. thank you in advance for your attention and
interest in this matter.
the author responds: ""i imagine that you are asserting here that moore's
melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the sources
& bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. be assured i
will look further into\par this. thank you again for your response,
captain rydell. i should be posting a revised version of the page in the
next week or so."" (june 7, 1999)

june 1, 1999: news release
part one background:
on may 21, 1999, the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the
republic of the marshall islands posted a ""press release"" on the
internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0
(discontinued as of 12/1/00). the author, ""mr. joseph biglar,
undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated
with the government of the kingdom of enenkio, nor with its monarch, his
majesty king remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or
state activities of enenkio. there is no valid reason to assume that the
said ""press release"" is indeed an official document.
the republic of the marshall islands has perfect knowledge that
representatives of the kingdom of enenkio, headed by his majesty king
remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right
and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons,
many of whom happen to be marshallese nationals residing in the marshall
islands.
response to so-called ""press release"":
this unprovoked attack upon his majesty king remios, monarch of the
kingdom of enenkio, by the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the
republic of the marshall islands is wholly false. it is also
unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an
unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon
marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of
the republic of the marshall islands, which has been confirmed by the
u.s. state department. (see: human rights report)
this public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the marshall
islands government that any attempt to interfere in the business of his
majesty king remios, iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the
marshall islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention.
the rmi is unequivocally cognizant that the kingdom of enenkio:
ã‚â» ã‚â» exists as a sovereign state as defined by the montevideo
convention (1933).
ã‚â» ã‚â» was conceived as a separate independent state by its
sovereign,
iroijlaplap murjel hermios, in 1987.
ã‚â» ã‚â» was established by way of a public authority, the
constitution
of the kingdom of enenkio atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people.
ã‚â» ã‚â» has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many
other
states, including the dominion of melchizedek
ã‚â» ã‚â» has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over
islands
and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as
- now quoting mr. biglar's statement - ""rmi geographical and political
boundaries.""
ã‚â» ã‚â» exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional
and
matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred
heritage of marshallese customary law (reinforced by the rmi
constitution), upon the acknowledged iroijlaplaps of the northern ratak
atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by ministry
of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands.
ã‚â» ã‚â» has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its
political
jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and
seas of eneen-kio atoll to the government or people of the dominion of
melchizedek or to any other entity, including the republic of the
marshall islands.
mr. biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the republic of the marshall
islands:
ã‚â» ã‚â» also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the
montevideo
convention (1933).
ã‚â» ã‚â» was conceived as a separate state by (un) foreign
governments,
which included the united states, china and the ussr.
ã‚â» ã‚â» was also established under a public authority, the
constitution
of the marshall islands, ratified in 1979 by its people.
ã‚â» ã‚â» has no relations with enenkio that allows rmi knowledge of
anything that is not also public information and no such public
information respecting relations with the dominion of melchizedek has
ever been disseminated to harm the rmi to be condemned by mr. biglar.
ã‚â» ã‚â» has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the
islands
and seas of eneen-kio atoll, which was not incorporated into the rmi in
1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any
present or former iroijlaplap or monarch thereof and any statement to
the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter.
ã‚â» ã‚â» exercises authorities founded upon the rmi constitution,
which
does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over
territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of eneen-kio
atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant
matter.
ã‚â» ã‚â» has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the kingdom
of
enenkio in their every attempt to get the rmi government to mitigate the
suffering of people residing in the ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of
iroijlaplap hermios, and the rmi has rejected every suggestion to
coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said iroijlaplap
hermios.
the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the
marshall islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements
or actions by the administration of the republic of the marshall islands
which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility,
existence or authority of the government of the kingdom of enenkio in
the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication
by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as
deliberate acts of aggression upon the monarch of the kingdom, his
majesty king remios, as head of state, the government of the kingdom of
enenkio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate
responsive measures.
furthermore, in light of the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of
the republic of the marshall islands announcement concerning the kingdom
of enenkio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following
statement in the preamble of the constitution of the marshall islands,
then you decide for yourself:
""with this constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace
and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the
aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and
striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal.""
on behalf of his majesty king remios, we, administrators of the kingdom
of enenkio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a
free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

news release, part two, june 1, 1999
part two background:
the international narcotics control strategy report, 1998 (click on
reference # 2 below) released by the bureau for international narcotics
and law enforcement affairs, u.s. department of state, washington dc,
february 1999, states as follows:
""where are ofcs located?
[paragraph 4] thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction
anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging ofc. the newest
ofcs, e.g., niue and the marshall islands, are now sprouting in remote
areas of the world, such as the pacific. even more ""remote"" are mere
figments of fertile imaginations such as the dominion of malchizedek
(sic) or the kingdom of enenkio atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in
intent and practice."" [note: ofc = offshore financial center]
response:
this unprovoked attack upon his majesty king remios, monarch of the
kingdom of enenkio, the sovereign state of enenkio and its noble
citizenry by the u.s. department of state is a reprehensible
categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the kingdom of
enenkio. it is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an
unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of his
majesty king remios, the government of the kingdom of enenkio and organs
thereof.
the unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the united states to attempt
to link the kingdom of enenkio with international crime, narcotics
trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels,
terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without
even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate
such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least.
this public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the united
states government that any attempt to interfere in the business of his
majesty king remios, iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the
marshall islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention.
furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the president of the
united states issues a formal apology to his majesty king remios, along
with the government of the kingdom of enenkio, and the congress of the
united states initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of
power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the united
states of the islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll. congressional
representatives to hawaii, the nearest state of the united states to
eneen-kio atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised
of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in
kind. the united states is obligated as the self-assured trustee of
pacific island states in micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic
cleansing"" and her responsibility to enenkio is no less.

march 16, 1999: news release
the impact of the passing on december 10 of his majesty murjel hermios,
first monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, iroijlaplap of the northern
ratak atolls of the marshall islands, beloved husband and father, was
felt throughout the society.ã‚â  flags were flown at half mast for a
week
in the marshalls and for a a month at enenkio consulates around the
world.ã‚â  his remains were interred in a remote site reserved for the
highest ranking chiefs, according to marshallese custom.
ã‚â 
his majesty king remios hermios
second monarch of the kingdom of enenkio
he was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, remios, who will
formally accept the staff of authority as second monarch, titular head
of state of the kingdom of enenkio in ceremonies being planned.ã‚â 
his
majesty remios hermios was a retired educator in the marshalls and
maintains a home in the ratak atolls. his successor is designated to be
his brother, hrh crown prince lobadreo hermios.

march 1999 -- comments to readers from the ministry of foreign affairs:
subject: a ""state of war"" declaration
the kingdom of enenkio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of
interests exists between it and the united states government.ã‚â  the
united states government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism,
appears to have violated the laws of nature and the law of nations in
""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the northern ratak state,
which then had formal treaties with the republic of germany.ã‚â  the
explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of marshallese homeland by
agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments
of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many
marshallese.ã‚â  because of continual neglect misrepresentation and
outright exploitation, these scars on marshallese society have not
healed.
thus a current state of adversity exists.ã‚â  following four years of
attempts to cause the united states to evaluate the plight of the
marshallese of the northern ratak imposed by its actions with respect to
wake island, the government of enenkio, on behalf of the marshallese
king, issued the ""'state of war', a declaration"" and broadcast it to the
world.ã‚â  the people were displaced from their native lands and kept
as
virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue
of being kept out.ã‚â  it was through this pragmatic initiative that
the
kingdom of enenkio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon
the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the
ancestors of the ratak paramount chief, king murjel hermios.
in retrospect, the declaration has had little visible effect.ã‚â 
while a
state of adversity does exist, the hope for american recognition of past
wrongs remains on the horizon.ã‚â  the kingdom of enenkio does not
condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or
agent of any government.ã‚â  such unnecessary means would diminish any
hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the
cause of peace within the family of nations.ã‚â  the kingdom of
enenkio
also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of
the marshallese people.
while the kingdom of enenkio continues to seek accountability of the
u.s. congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the un charter,
conventions of the united nations relating to self-determination,
preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses,
it believes accountability requires the u.s. to meet the pleas of the
people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.ã‚â  the refusal
of
the u.s. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple
discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with
representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity,
turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of
the marshallese people to whom the u.s. pledged in good faith to execute
the 1947 mandates of the united nations and its members.ã‚â  your
understanding is appreciated.ã‚â

december 19, 1998: news release
subject: death of the monarch of the kingdom of enenkio
the government has declared a period of national mourning on the
occasion of the death of the first monarch of the kingdom of enenkio,
his majesty king murjel hermios. embassies, missions and regional posts
are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 january 1999.
memorial services, held in the marshall islands where hm hermios made
his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of
traditional marshallese leaders. his remains will be interred in a
family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved.
irooj hermios was head of state of the kingdom of enenkio, revered as
monarch over the islands of eneen-kio atoll, esteemed as iroijlaplap and
high chief of the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago, beloved as
our brother and trusted as a friend. his successor as iroijlaplap is to
be formally named by a council of traditional leaders. selection of a
successor to the monarchy of the kingdom is in process and will be
announced at a later date. in the interim, a reagent will serve as head
of state.
hm hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as
iroijlaplap. aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the
marshalls, part of micronesia in the north pacific ocean and first
discovered by european seamen in the 16th century, were found to have a
well-developed societal structure. many nations have since, mostly by
force, prevailed over the marshall islands, imposed unaccustomed western
ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and
beauty. today this area is commonly known as wake atoll and is illegally
occupied by the federal government of the united states.
in one of the most courageous acts in recent times, irooj hermios
clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in
interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of eneen-kio
atoll for his beloved people. (the account of his acts to establish the
kingdom of enenkio as an island state, independent of the governments of
the marshalls and the united states, may be researched at the official
internet site.
on behalf of the government of the kingdom of enenkio, we are extremely
grateful for his dedication to the people of the marshall islands and
are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be
recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people
by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish marshallese
domination over eneen-kio atoll. we are saddened that our brother has
passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to marshallese
ancestry and traditions. in lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the
mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. sincerest best
wishes for the holiday season and the coming new year are extended to
all in peace.

july 14, 1998: communiquãƒâ© to correspondents
recent articles defaming the government of the kingdom of enenkio have
been maliciously published under the guise of a marshall islands
government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". we have once more
admonished the writer of the articles in the marshall islands for
disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased
report. we urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding
the kingdom of enenkio which are not validated. to that end, you are
cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or
concerns. for your advice, the following statement was issued by the
state secretary of the kingdom in reply:
the kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. no
claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any
claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in
the world. we are working vigorously to regain occupation of the
ancestral property of hm king hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of
war"" that exists with the united states government and to be accepted as
an honorable state among nations.
the kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting
authority over land ...within the geographical and political
boundaries..."" of the rmi. we are however striving to expel the armed
imperialistic invasion forces of the united states from the shores of
eneen-kio atoll so natural marshallese supremacy can be re-establish
there. as to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one
has dared to come forward with any such a charge. we say, let the issue
be played out in the people's venue for the record, not in a libelous
weekly publication. while we do not wear our brief history on our
shirtsleeves, our raison d'ãƒâªtre is clearly mandated in the preamble
to
the constitution of enenkio, which can be seen at our web site:
http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org
referencing the news article in the marshall islands journal entitled
""kingdom of enenkio sets up in new zealand,"" of may 1st, the editor was
advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver
licenses can be purchased from the kingdom's web site. the kingdom of
enenkio does not sell passports! if you have evidence to the contrary,
our foreign ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so
steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. you are
advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an enenkio passport, that such
an act is patently illegal.
the published statement, ""the group ...claims to represent iroijlaplap
murjel hermios and the atolls of the ratak chain..."", is wholly false. i
have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and
ample information is available at our internet site to refute the
statement. the kingdom does not represent any area outside of its
territorial boundaries, as the ratak atolls surely are. contrary to
their libelous statements, the kingdom of enenkio was not ""created"" by
robert moore and he is not a ""honolulu-based attorney.""
hm king murjel hermios is the acknowledged hereditary iroijlaplap of the
northern ratak atolls and is also first monarch of the kingdom, not of
his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens
who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. such a noble and
peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""enenkio"" [sic]
(actually enen-kio or eneen-kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is
the first marshallese name for a marshallese atoll located roughly 300
miles north of bok-ak (taongi) atoll. ""wake"" is a fictitious moniker
applied to the re-discovered eneen-kio atoll by unknown western society
writers.

may 4, 1997: news release
subject: issuance of gold stamps
the government of the kingdom of enenkio proudly announces commissioning
of its inaugural issue of gold stamps. this announcement, made at the
first sunday hawaii stamp, coin and postcard show may 4th, was the first
pre-publication public notice of the issuance of gold stamps by the
kingdom. stamps are expected to be off the presses by early june 1997.
first day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""first
day of issue"" by the kingdom will be available for a limited time
following the dates of release. distributors, dealers and collectors are
encouraged sign up as a charter member of the enenkio philatelic mint
mailing list.
background - the kingdom was established in march 1993, and the
government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution
in september 1994. however, due to u.s. military activities on the
island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of
the kingdom lingers in ""exile"". several nations have extended
recognition of the sovereignty of the kingdom, documents of citizenship
are being issued and legations are located in europe, south america, usa
and elsewhere.
a nation in conflict - the land in question, commonly known as wake
island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned
names of westerners who visited them: wake, wilkes and peale. few people
in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the
atoll eneen-kio lived in the marshall islands, exercised constant
jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and
cultural site. by way of developing the atoll as a nation, the
government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial
title to ""wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at
the will of the people. the united states of america began in a similar
fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. lawful
return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by
congressional apology to hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the
monarchy.
""state of war"" - by way of an official march 1997 declaration sent to
top u.s. officials, the kingdom of enenkio has acknowledged that a
virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the
blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from
united states warships. the primary objective of the notice was to
request a congressional investigation into actual events and related
factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the north pacific
ocean by the united states. calls to end u.s. operations, vacate the
atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the kingdom
have fallen on deaf ears. despite repeated notices, letters and legal
advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events
and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the
world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights
violations by federal agents of the united states government.
inaugural issue - the gold stamps are based on events of the past and
dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium
nears. for that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the
basis for evaluation. since the relative value of gold in world markets
varies according to the value and stability of national currency units,
the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with
any particular currency. however, the real or intrinsic value of the
stamps will remain as constant as gold. the extrinsic value will be
determined by philatelic collectors around the world. note: stamps are
printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended
for use as money.
closing comments - the government of the kingdom appeals to all people
from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the kingdom of
enenkio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the pacific region. in
doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the
federal government of the united states and asks that everyone with
human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. the proceeds from
the sale of gold stamps will help fund the restoration of the kingdom
and end the conflict in peace.

march 31, 1997: news release
an official document entitled a declaration, was sent march 22 to top
executive and legislative officials in the federal government of the
united states, including selected cabinet members. the document asserts
that: ""a state of war exists over the kingdom of enenkio atoll by way of
acts by the federal government of the united states."" this is the most
recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. one
of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a
congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding
the illegal seizure of islands in the north pacific ocean by the united
states.
this latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of
disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the
government of the kingdom was established in march 1993, each with
similar objectives. calls for the u.s. to cease operations, vacate the
premises, negotiate return of the island to the king, apologize and
compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal
action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal
government. likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal
announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and
failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world
regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by
the united states.
the land in question, commonly called wake island, is comprised of three
small islands, wake, wilkes and peale, named by ""western explorers"" for
western persons. what of the native discoverers? the crux of the issue
is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex matriarchal land
tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal
chiefs of the northern ratak atolls of marshall islands, the united
states seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in
1898, and again in1899. historical records reveal that the multiple
landings by united states warships, en route to the philippines on war
missions, and subsequent congressional action, were the sole basis of
the u.s. claim. the motivation was said to be for the establishment of a
cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the
east. such a station was never established at wake island. it was
destined to become a military installation.
however, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the u.s. president
by the german consul in the marshall islands and some measure of
correspondence followed. but since the u.s. abandoned the area without
establishing a colony or cable station and germany was defeated in the
first world war, the objections fell into oblivion. it is understood
from written accounts of oral marshallese culture and traditions, that
jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. the u.s. did not
establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the caa
(predecessor of the faa) allowed pan american airways to build a base
for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. clearly, the so-called
annexation by the u.s. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently
illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid.
when the u.s. congress apologized for the overthrow of the hawaiian
monarchy in 1993 and the u.s. navy subsequently returned culturally
significant land to the ""natives"" of hawaii, a landmark legal precedent
was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of wake
island. the islands of eneen-kio, as the northernmost atoll in the ratak
chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of
micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the marshall
group. while not being used for navy target practice as kaho'olawe was,
the use of the islands of eneen-kio atoll and the military mission at
wake airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby
activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or
quintessential knowledge by the american public.
even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by christian
missionaries, natives continued to use eneen-kio, authority to go there
being issued by the ratak iroijlaplap (paramount chief). king murjel
hermios holds that title today. by way of developing the atoll in
sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder
of the allodial title to wake island. the u.s. cannot produce a title.
the hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from
aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its
marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures
the rights of ownership.
upon the basis of events and actions by the united states, the
administration of the kingdom of enenkio, by virtue of the declaration,
""yields to the recognition that a state of war"" exists over the island
nation. this is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or
unconditional surrender. sovereignty and independence of the kingdom,
over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. the belief is that
truth and law is on the side of the kingdom and that reckless abuse of
power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the
record of u.s. ""ownership"" and occupation. native north americans are
all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it
comes to seizure of land and denial of rights.
in the declaration, demands are made as follows:
ã‚â» ã‚â» ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an
honorable
accord for the survivors of the said state of war..."".
ã‚â» ã‚â» ""if unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to
submit to
impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and war
reparations to citizens.""
ã‚â» ã‚â» ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
every
action of every kind in or on enenkio atoll or within the 200-mile
exclusive economic zone...""
ã‚â» ã‚â» ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in
commerce by failure the department of the interior
ã‚â» ã‚â» ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more
than
twenty-seven consecutive months and most recently referenced by a
certified invoice, no. 97-us-03, dated march 10, 1997, for which it is
obligated to pay.""
ã‚â» ã‚â» that the ""...congress of the united states is obliged to
immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating
the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights
and due process..."".
the government of the kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable
nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the
kingdom of enenkio atoll as an independent nation under god. it seeks a
peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of
the united states and asks them to use their influence accordingly.
appeals are being made to the united nations.

february 6, 1995: news release
on behalf of his majesty, king murjel hermios, monarch of enenkio atoll,
titular head of state, paramount chief (iroijlaplap) of the northern
atolls of the ratak archipelago of pacific ocean islands of the marshall
islands, i bid you a warm marshallese greeting -- yokwe!
the purpose of this notice is twofold: first, to admonish those of you
to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to
take action; second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take
appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. as long as
you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy
insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the
federal government of the united states remains resolutely silent, your
anonymity and that of your publication is well served.
summary of events 1993-94:
two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment
of a new island nation in the pacific ocean, enenkio, formerly known as
wake island. the first was issued on february 25, 1994. it followed two
announcements: 1) officials of the us air force at hickam afb, hawaii
said in articles published new year's eve and day in both honolulu
newspapers that the usaf no longer wanted to maintain wake island
airfield and wanted to turn it over to interior department or another
military organization by 1 february and abandon it by 1 october, 1994;
2) us army space and strategic defense command of huntsville, alabama
issued an environmental impact assessment for a proposed missile launch
program out of wake island; part of the ""star wars"" program, i am led to
believe.
an emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of enenkio was
held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under
the jurisdiction of hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of
independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as
king. letters to mr. clinton, members of congress, u.s. army and the
first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of enenkio (wake
i., peale i., wilkes i.), denounced the army's so-called ""no significant
impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature
into and over the waters of the marshall islands (including its
sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership
claims.
on march 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the
nation of enenkio as an independent nation under the authority of his
majesty murjel hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to mr.
robert moore, appointed minister plenipotentiary. the constitution,
succession act and other documents were thereafter drafted.
on september 30th, a formal declaration of sovereignty was signed into
law by ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the
usa founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the
people. it declared the kingdom of enenkio a sovereign independent
peaceful nation, it acknowledged his majesty, king murjel hermios as
owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as head of state and
embraced the constitution as the founding document for a form of
democratic government.
documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world
proclaiming the above actions. formal documents of recognition were
presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation
requested. copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the united
nations, un security council, nato, south pacific commission and others.
letters of personal appeal were sent to un leaders. a special request
for protection and assistance was sent to the un security council.
on october 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent
via certified mail to federal officers of the united states regarding
the illegal january 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the
islands of eneen-kio atoll, the adverse occupation and continued
disregard of international human rights law, un charter terms and terms
of the compact of free association with the republic of the marshall
islands (public law 99-239; january 14, 1986). having acknowledged
receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the u.s. is now
in default under commercial law, owing in excess of us$100 million.
the second official press release was issued on november 21, 1994,
relating the preceding events. of all the agencies to whom it was sent,
only two, the marshall islands journal, a weekly newspaper and islands
business pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then
only briefly.
request for media response:
the thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural
calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and
deception seems seriously lacking. is not the peaceful beginning of a
new nation news any more? is not the restoration of native rights of an
aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth
of jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? how about
suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the
security and peaceful existence of nations of the pacific in the name of
""world leadership""? or is it world domination?
people of enenkio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an
effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby,
hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of
their ancestral heritage:
1. investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed
invasion supported by u.s. expansionism and subsequent improper
annexation of the sacred islands of eneen-kio atoll, then being utilized
by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the marshallese civilization and for
at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (note: these facts and
validity of the hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a
fabrication.)
2. investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of
specific beneficial use and u.s. policy, past and present, or the lack
thereof, with regard to the role of enenkio . (note: it is my
understanding wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing""
of thousands of south vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s).
3. reflect on the contrasting history of u.s. occupation, war,
technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds
against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop
serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind.
4. respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the
king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the
citizens of enenkio to self-determination and the commitment by their
government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and
fiscal manner.
5. bring to light u.s. strategy with regard to the implementation of
questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation,
offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research,
environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (note:
congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of wake island
and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets
and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less
publicized projects.)
6. fully disclose to the people of the united states u.s. strategy with
regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to eneen-kio atoll by
king hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored
and respected marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for human
rights protected under international law, united nations charter and
conventions and the u.s. compact with the marshall islands and refusal
to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military
and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (note: u.s. apology
for the illegal armed overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy the prior year
and the return of the hawaiian island, kaho'olawe, also of religious
significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by enenkio
citizens.)
parting shot:
what truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in
general, the u.s. federal government more precisely, which somehow
behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the
right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest
inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. such an
approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner
of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright
alarming. it is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent
trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports,
forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and
virtually every action initiated by those representing king hermios have
escaped official response from officers of the u.s. federal government.
our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable
thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry
of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked american foreign policy of a
century ago. if this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only
be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of
american attempts at ""fixing up the world"". the title of ownership and
inheritance of eneen-kio atoll pre-dates formation of the united states
by two centuries or more. it is time the significance of native cultures
and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from
matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in
determining the future course of human endeavor. people have a right to
know; the media a responsibility to show them.
in conclusion, i reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is
one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of u.s. political
philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives
for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of human
cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of god-given individual
rights.
thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and
forced exile of our proud citizenry.

november 21, 1994: news release
in a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands
which include wake island, site of a u.s. military outpost, his majesty,
king murjel hermios, through his legal representative, minister
plenipotentiary, robert moore, the u.s. has been given the boot out of
wake island. moore served legal notice on top u.s. government officials
in october 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. the filing
came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the
illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of king hermios) by
the gun boat, uss bennington in 1899.
the legal document, a commercial affidavit, declaration of fair value
and demand for payment, was served under recognized principles of common
law and international commercial codes. it details the specifics of king
hermios' ancestral rights to wake island, the illegality of the u.s.
claim and violations of native laws, international agreements and human
rights during their 95-year hold on the hermios property. it also
establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to
answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the hermios claim to stand
valid before the law as unchallenged. under those claims, demand was
made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land.
continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per
month through 1995.
while putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, u.s.
officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which
keep king hermios and the citizens of enenkio living in compulsory
exile.
eneen-kio atoll, a name derived from marshallese traditions involving a
small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands,
including wake. predecessors in interest of king hermios, aboriginal
chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to eneen-kio atoll for
religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years bc.
during the colonial invasion of pacific islands, western traders and
explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the
real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the
islanders themselves. a case in point is in that of the hawaiians, who
recently gained an apology from the u.s. congress and president bill
clinton for the illegal u.s. government overthrow of the hawaiian
monarchy.
king hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary paramount chief
(iroijlaplap) of all the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago of the
marshall islands, which terminates to the north, beyond eneen-kio atoll.
mr. moore has full authority to act on the king's behalf to rid the
islands of their illegal and unwanted occupation forces in favor of
restoring the king's assertion of his native allodial rights. most
recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the u.s. air
force command, 15th logistics group, hickam afb, hawaii.
nearly identical articles published in the star bulletin and honolulu
advertiser on december 31, 1993 and january 1, 1994 headlined: ""air
force willing to give up its hold on wake island"" and stated: ""not much
activity there anymore, so the air force wants to give up control"".
according to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private
entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a
stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral
heritage of king hermios, his predecessors and people.
mr. moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation
under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate
and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to
direct all affairs of state. the democratic government is established as
a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its executive
council.
since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the
effects of a stroke, mr. moore has been unsuccessful in getting any
substantive reply from officers of the united states, military officers
and members of congress. the following is a summary of some of the
recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the
lawful and rightful landowner, king murjel hermios:
ã‚â» ã‚â» formal letters to president clinton and vice-president al
gore
in february 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in
their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were
ignored. as a military base, wake airfield was ""decommissioned"" more
than a decade ago.
ã‚â» ã‚â» in response to the environmental assessment of the
proposed
theater missile defense rocket launch activities, formal letters of
protest sent to the pentagon and u.s. army officials, who contemplated
launching hundreds of missiles from wake island over several years into
the waters of the marshall islands, went unanswered.
ã‚â» ã‚â» letters to members of the u.s. congress protesting rocket
launch
activities and requesting help went unanswered.
ã‚â» ã‚â» a resolution dated march 21, 1994 was signed which
declared the
status of enenkio to be that of an independent nation under the
administrative jurisdiction of king murjel hermios. it was likewise
ignored.
after waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the
declared status of enenkio and having heard no objection from the united
states, mr. moore assembled the ministers of the executive council.
they, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied
access to eneen-kio, formally passed and signed the declaration of
sovereignty on september 30, 1994. they also accepted the draft of the
constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government
recognizing his majesty, king murjel hermios as head of state and his
family as the first royal family of enenkio .
while the king and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of
foreign invaders of eneen-kio atoll, which over the centuries included
agents of the emperor of japan, the emperor of germany, and the king of
spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the
past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the
future in support of the sacred principals of truth, honor and peace.
those principals are embodied in the constitutions of enenkio and of the
united states.
those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the u.s.
congress in public law 99-239 (jan. 14, 1986), signed by president
ronald reagan as the compact of free association with the marshall
islands and federated states of micronesia. the compact acknowledges
superiority of all marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of
ownership and use of land.
still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary u.s. military
might and the willingness to use it against even the smallest of nations
(e.g. grenada, haiti, cuba, hawaii, etc., etc.), mr. moore, other
ministers and the citizens of enenkio are determined to peacefully
displace the u.s. occupation forces and reassert the jurisdiction of his
majesty, king murjel hermios. filing the commercial affidavit document
was the first major legal step in a series of actions that could end up
in international court of justice in the hague, netherlands.
in an effort to garner support for the repatriation of her citizens, the
restoration of democratic control of enenkio and to gain international
recognition of the innumerable native rights violations against the
sovereign and his forebears, the ministers of enenkio have sent
documents of notice and request for assistance to the united nations
security council, the south pacific commission, similar organizations
and to the governments of most other nations of the world.
it is hoped that mutual recognition of sovereignty and the establishment
of diplomatic ties will invite the willful withdrawal of u.s. troops and
relinquishment of their unfounded territorial claims. at the same time,
mr. moore, in the service of his majesty, king murjel hermios, wishes to
inform all of the people being held at wake island by force of arms or
by contract, that asylum will be offered to them. a similar offer is
made to all marshallese descendants who desire to become citizens of
enenkio.

grants money - guaranteed! ""each day over one million dollars in free
government
grantsâ  is given away to people just like you for a wide
variety of business and personal needs
â â â â â â â 
dear grant seeker,
in a moment, i'll tell you
exactly how & where to get grants. this money has to
be given away, why not to you?
you may be thinking, ""how
can i get some of this free grants money""
maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?
let me tell you it's not
impossible! it's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
united states are receiving millions of dollars from these government and
private foundation's everyday.
who can apply?
anyone can apply
for a grant from 18 years old and up!
grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! grants don't have to be paid back,
ever! claim
your slice of the free american pie.
this money is not a loan,
trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
these government agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.
you decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the government
agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
this money is non taxable & interest free.
none of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and u.s. citizen are entitled to this money.
there are currently over
1,400 federal programs, 24,000 state programs, 30,000 private foundations
and 20,000 scholarship programs available.
this year over $30 billion
dollars in free personal and business government grants money will be given
away by government grants agencies.
â government personal
and business grants facts:
over 20 million people get government
money every year:
1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money

4,000,000 people get money to invest
in real estate
6,000,000 people get money to go
to college
10,000,000 people get free help and
training for a better job

into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where free business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the federal

it
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the united
states of america wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in free
consulting and research grants.
with an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
in
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
most
people never apply for free business grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.the fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive free grants money and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.government grants

1,"dear sir,my name is mr. obi w, the manager, credit and foreign bills of eco
bank plc. i am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank
with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash
[korean air flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on august 6,
1997.since the demise of this our customer, i personally has watched
with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive
as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million
five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my
branch for a very long time. on this note, i decided to seek for whom
his name shall be used as the
next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. and the
banking ethics here does not
allow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be
recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. in view
of this i got your contact through a trade journal after realizing
that your name and country is similar to the deceased. i will give
you 25% of the total.upon the receipt of your response, i will send you by fax or e-mail
the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. i will
not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and
that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund
transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply
to the bank as a relation to the deceased.when you receive this letter. kindly send me an e-mail signifying
your decision including your private tel/fax numbers for quick
communication.respectfully submitted,obi   w.

our last pick 
symphony telecom (otcbb: sypy) went up 100% in just one week!!!
indiginet identifies 
acquisition targets with combined revenues of $35 million...
â 
telecom consolidation begins to accelerate the wall street bulletin believes 
that the recent 
investment of capital into level 3, lead by warren buffett, 
is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication 
market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid-sized 
enterprises. after the boom and bust comes the revival. for some 
carriers drowning in debt, such as global crossing and worldcom, 
the future may be dim. but for those survivors of the industry 
that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems 
mean opportunity. ""every major industry in the history of 
the united states has experienced a similar transformation, from 
the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s 
to the dot-coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says robert 
saunders, director of the eastern management group market 
research firm. christopher 
dean, cto of oss company eftia, says ""we are seeing all 
the people that are the survivors. there's all this pent-up money 
and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used 
to cost a few billion for a few millions."" read the full 
story from telecommunications magazine - see the link at the end 
of this newsletter. 
as we write this report, our new recommendation 
indiginet, inc. (otcbb: 
igtt) has only been trading on the otc bulletin board since 
late may of 2002. as indiginet, inc. continues to implement its 
business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way 
up for the resurgence of the telecom sector. this could be our 
strongest recommendation of the year. we are giving igtt our highest 
rating of strong buy/aggressive growth.
â 
ground floor opportunity / tremendous 
growth potential 
we believe igtt will perform equally to, if not 
greater than its competition. a similar telecommunications company, 
talk america holdings (nasdaq: talk), share 
price began to explode in april of this year moving from just 
over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late june. talk america 
holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but 
today has a market cap of $267 million.
igtt curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. 
using the talk model for potential growth, igtt could very well 
be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market 
cap in excess of $250 million. this would be an increase of 1000%. 
so you see why igtt has such great potential and the time is right 
 for investors to get in on the ground floor.
â 
the indignet strategy
indiginet, inc. is an integrated solutions company 
that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (smes) with an integrated 
communication solution. indiginet is a prestigious ""diamond"" 
level partner of avaya, as well as a reseller for cisco and 
compaq. the company will offer data, local, long distance and 
wireless services to smes over third party networks enabling the 
company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the 
capital burden of building a communication network. the companyâ€™s 
strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market 
communication companies and attractively priced internet 
service providers (isps). the company recently completed 
its acquisitions of fox telecommunications and wbconnect. 
indiginet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow 
revenue and enhance profitability. smes account for $120 billion 
in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, 
or 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending 
is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years.

â 
the it market
based on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 
million smes currently lag significantly in the utilization of 
it and data 
communications, including internet access, web services, business 
software and e-commerce. worldwide it spending increased to $981 
billion us for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 
2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher 
idc. it spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, 
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for 
the first time. in idc's revised forecasts for it spending in 
2002 and 2003, it spending in the us is expected to increase by 
3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth 
of 9 percent in 2003. western europe can expect growth of 4 percent 
in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. though japan will experience flat 
growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will 
return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown 
in china, india, korea, russia, the philippines, south africa 
and poland. source: idc
â 
particulars
the wall street bulletin is putting igtt on our 
strong buy/aggressive growth recommendation list for the following 
reasons:
1. the company's strategy is to acquire the customer 
bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively 
priced internet service providers (isps). the company will sell 
its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that 
will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all 
types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, 
and data. 2. the company is currently serving many customers in the denver/front 
range communities but in particular the education vertical market 
has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data 
network into the existing campus network. the company's customers 
include united states olympic committee 
(usoc), university of denver, 
and colorado state university. 
3. the company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues 
to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy 
court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer 
bases. each of the targeted companies are within the company's 
footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the 
company's embedded customer base. 
â 
investment consideration
indiginet inc recently filed its 10qsb, for the 
three months ended march 31, 2002. igtt reported revenues of $339,694 
in q1 2002 vs. revenues of $0 in q1 2001. at this current growth 
rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first 
year of production with no increases in acquisitions. as more 
and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors 
will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment 
dollars.

may i briefly introduce myself to you. i am hajia maryam abacha, the wife of late nigerian head of state, general sanni abacha, who died on the 8th of june 1998. ever since the death of my husband, my family has been facing a lot of problems mostly with the present civilian government. consequently, my son - mohammed abacha has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to make a lot of confessions as regards valuables and money, including that of my late husband entrusted in his hand for safe keeping. 
the latest is the confession of the us$700,000,000.00 (seven hundred million united states dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping. please check news watch magazine of may 8th / 15th, 2000 issue on [website:http://www.newswatchngr.com] to confirm the above story. also the recent publication by this day newspaper on thursday march 1st edition, which london court clear ways for more recovery of abacha's family looted money. please confirm this issue on website; http://www.thisdayonline.com, click the archieve/2001/march 2001/thursday march 1st.
on this note, i deposited a total sum of us$40,300,000.00 (forty million, three hundred thousand united states dollars) sometimes march last year with a security company abroad (name withheld for now). normally, we (1 and mohammed abacha) usually do such transactions, by first sending the money out by cargo to security company outside nigeria, as photographic materials.
and thereafter go to the security company for claims before transferring it to any bank of our choice. presently, i cannot travel out of nigeria, because, if you have gone through the above mentioned website address, you will see how my son's confessions had implicated my husband and in fact the whole of my family. this has actually caused the federal government of nigeria to confiscate our international passports, frozen every of my family member's bank accounts, both home and abroad, even our properties. 
my problem now is, i want someone that can assist me move the us$40,300,000.00 (forty million three hundred thousand united states dollars) out from the security company and move the money to your country.
i shall be ready to negotiate with you any percentage you might want from the sum. on your advice i shall be ready to invest my own share of the sum in your country. i assure you that there will be no problems at all in the course of moving out the money. please kindly contact me on my e-mail:mrsabacha_11@mail.com or fax 234-1-7590893, i shall so much appreciate your immediate response for full details of the business which shall be given to you by my second son mallam mustafa abacha. you should note also that my son - mallam mustapha abacha shall handle all cases as regards this business; as he is well abreast with this transaction for i do not have access to telephone lines now because they have been tossed by security agents and my movement is being monitored. i would like my son (mallam mustafa abacha) to settle down  or be involved in a dating relationship with any lucky foreign lady at the successful completion of the transaction.
in acknowledgement of my proposal, i would want you to furnish me with your telephone number, fax number and address so as to enable my son whom will be dealing with you directly to easily have you communicate as to how you will receive this money on our behalf risk-free.
thanking you in anticipation to your kind understanding and cooperation. i am looking forward for a healthy business relationship with you  and my entire household. hoping to hear from you.best regards,hajia maryam abacha.call me on my telephone number 234-80-33357110please for security reasons reply through to the fax number fax 234-1-7590893 instead of the email as it is general to all the family member.",1,1,0

hi! my name is frank kern. i'd like for you to know up front that i'm not an internet guru...not a computer wiz...and not a marketing genius. 
first of all, i'll admit that i don't expect you to believe a single word i say. 
after all, how many times a day are you bombarded with some ""get-rich-quick"" scheme on the internet?
you probably get a brand new promise of instant wealth every few hours in your e-mail box and if you're anything like me, you've tried a few and been left with nothing but a hole in your pocket!
well, i've got great news for you.

free personal and business grants
â "" qualify for at least $25,000 in free
grants money - guaranteed! ""each day over one million dollars in free
government
grantsâ  is given away to people just like you for a wide
variety of business and personal needs
â â â â â â â 
dear grant seeker,
in a moment, i'll tell you
exactly how & where to get grants. this money has to
be given away, why not to you?
you may be thinking, ""how
can i get some of this free grants money""
maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?
let me tell you it's not
impossible! it's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
united states are receiving millions of dollars from these government and
private foundation's everyday.
who can apply?
anyone can apply
for a grant from 18 years old and up!
grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! grants don't have to be paid back,
ever! claim
your slice of the free american pie.
this money is not a loan,
trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
these government agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.
you decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the government
agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
this money is non taxable & interest free.
none of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply

unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before

help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.

people never apply for free business grants because they somehow feel it

the general feeling of the top internet lawyers and analysts is that ""online gambling and sports betting is here to stay.â” attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! banning internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that governments are ill equipped to enforce. whatâ’s more, there are no competitors for the companyâ’s method or technology for remote wagering. i2corp is the only company in the world that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. i2corp is currently negotiating with
major casinos globally.    
 
michael pollock of the pollock gaming resource group (prrg) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations. â“ the study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on-site patrons.â” a copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at http://www.gamingobserver.com/.
 
i2corp is the holding company for home gambling network, inc. hgn holds u.s. patent 5,800,268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. the patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live; the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event; and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. they include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other las vegas casino games. fact: currently there is an overwhelming opinion that remote wagering in real-time will become one of the most profitable/prolific industries worldwide. i2corp recently won judgment against giant uunet a subsidiary of mci/worldcom in a u.s. federal court for patent infringement. just another compelling reason why i2corp has orphaned their competition! therefore we conclude i2corpâ’s common stock to be overlooked and undervalued! recommendation: strong buy     i2corp

co-operation (awfc) of zimbabwe. after the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president mr. robert mugabe won the presidential election, the
government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. this programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white african farmers for redistribution to black africans. this programme has attracted worldwide
condemnation from world leaders including british prime minister,mr tony blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of
victimization and physical abuse.
   two weeks ago, our headquartes in harare was attacked and
looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which
belong to the co-operation. this cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government.
   now i have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. the cash in question is us$46million dollars.
   once i can get your commitment and sincerity of investing
this funds on our behalf then i would proceed to get the funds freighted to europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us.
   you do not have anything to worry about as i would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free.
   you would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe.
please get back to me if you can be of assistance and i would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government.
   i expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to
this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com

â 
telecom consolidation begins to accelerate the wall street bulletin believes 
that the recent 
investment of capital into level 3, lead by warren buffett, 
is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication 
market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid-sized 
enterprises. after the boom and bust comes the revival. for some 
carriers drowning in debt, such as global crossing and worldcom, 
the future may be dim. but for those survivors of the industry 
that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems 
mean opportunity. ""every major industry in the history of 
the united states has experienced a similar transformation, from 
the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s 
to the dot-coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says robert 
saunders, director of the eastern management group market 
research firm. christopher 
dean, cto of oss company eftia, says ""we are seeing all 
the people that are the survivors. there's all this pent-up money 
and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used 
to cost a few billion for a few millions."" read the full 
story from telecommunications magazine - see the link at the end 
of this newsletter. 
as we write this report, our new recommendation 
indiginet, inc. (otcbb: 
igtt) has only been trading on the otc bulletin board since 
late may of 2002. as indiginet, inc. continues to implement its 
business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way 
up for the resurgence of the telecom sector. this could be our 
strongest recommendation of the year. we are giving igtt our highest 
rating of strong buy/aggressive growth.
â 
ground floor opportunity / tremendous 
growth potential 
we believe igtt will perform equally to, if not 
greater than its competition. a similar telecommunications company, 
talk america holdings (nasdaq: talk), share 
price began to explode in april of this year moving from just 
over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late june. talk america 
holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but 
today has a market cap of $267 million.
igtt curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. 
using the talk model for potential growth, igtt could very well 
be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market 
cap in excess of $250 million. this would be an increase of 1000%. 
so you see why igtt has such great potential and the time is right 
 for investors to get in on the ground floor.
â 
the indignet strategy
indiginet, inc. is an integrated solutions company 
that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (smes) with an integrated 
communication solution. indiginet is a prestigious ""diamond"" 
level partner of avaya, as well as a reseller for cisco and 
compaq. the company will offer data, local, long distance and 
wireless services to smes over third party networks enabling the 
company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the 
capital burden of building a communication network. the companyâ€™s 
strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market 
communication companies and attractively priced internet 
service providers (isps). the company recently completed 
its acquisitions of fox telecommunications and wbconnect. 
indiginet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow 
revenue and enhance profitability. smes account for $120 billion 
in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, 
or 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending 
is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years. 
source: morgan stanley dean witter. 
the igtt web site: www.indiginet.com
â 
the it market
based on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 
million smes currently lag significantly in the utilization of 
it and data 
communications, including internet access, web services, business 
software and e-commerce. worldwide it spending increased to $981 
billion us for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 
2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher 
idc. it spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, 
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for 
the first time. in idc's revised forecasts for it spending in 
2002 and 2003, it spending in the us is expected to increase by 
3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth 
of 9 percent in 2003. western europe can expect growth of 4 percent 
in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. though japan will experience flat 
growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will 
return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown 
in china, india, korea, russia, the philippines, south africa 
and poland. source: idc
â 
particulars
the wall street bulletin is putting igtt on our 
strong buy/aggressive growth recommendation list for the following 
reasons:
1. the company's strategy is to acquire the customer 
bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively 
priced internet service providers (isps). the company will sell 
its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that 
will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all 
types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, 
and data. 2. the company is currently serving many customers in the denver/front 
range communities but in particular the education vertical market 
has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data 
network into the existing campus network. the company's customers 
include united states olympic committee 
(usoc), university of denver, 
and colorado state university. 
3. the company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues 
to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy 
court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer 
bases. each of the targeted companies are within the company's 
footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the 
company's embedded customer base. 
â 
investment consideration
indiginet inc recently filed its 10qsb, for the 
three months ended march 31, 2002. igtt reported revenues of $339,694 
in q1 2002 vs. revenues of $0 in q1 2001. at this current growth 
rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first 
year of production with no increases in acquisitions. as more 
and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors 
will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment 
dollars.

strongest recommendation of the year. we are giving igtt our highest 
rating of strong buy/aggressive growth.
â 
ground floor opportunity / tremendous 
growth potential 
we believe igtt will perform equally to, if not 
greater than its competition. a similar telecommunications company, 
talk america holdings (nasdaq: talk), share 
price began to explode in april of this year moving from just 
over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late june. talk america 
holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but 
today has a market cap of $267 million.
igtt curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. 
using the talk model for potential growth, igtt could very well 
be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market 
cap in excess of $250 million. this would be an increase of 1000%. 
so you see why igtt has such great potential and the time is right 
 for investors to get in on the ground floor.
â 
the indignet strategy
indiginet, inc. is an integrated solutions company 
that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (smes) with an integrated 
communication solution. indiginet is a prestigious ""diamond"" 
level partner of avaya, as well as a reseller for cisco and 
compaq. the company will offer data, local, long distance and 
wireless services to smes over third party networks enabling the 
company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the 
capital burden of building a communication network. the companyâ€™s 
strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market 
communication companies and attractively priced internet 
service providers (isps). the company recently completed 
its acquisitions of fox telecommunications and wbconnect. 
indiginet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow 
revenue and enhance profitability. smes account for $120 billion 
in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, 
or 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending 
is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years.

â 
the it market
based on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 
million smes currently lag significantly in the utilization of 
it and data 
communications, including internet access, web services, business 
software and e-commerce. worldwide it spending increased to $981 
billion us for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 
2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher 
idc. it spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, 
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for 
the first time. in idc's revised forecasts for it spending in 
2002 and 2003, it spending in the us is expected to increase by 
3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth 
of 9 percent in 2003. western europe can expect growth of 4 percent 
in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. though japan will experience flat 
growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will 
return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown 
in china, india, korea, russia, the philippines, south africa 
and poland. source: idc
â 
particulars
the wall street bulletin is putting igtt on our 
strong buy/aggressive growth recommendation list for the following 
reasons:
1. the company's strategy is to acquire the customer 
bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively 
priced internet service providers (isps). the company will sell 
its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that 
will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all 
types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, 
and data. 2. the company is currently serving many customers in the denver/front 
range communities but in particular the education vertical market 
has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data 
network into the existing campus network. the company's customers 
include united states olympic committee 
(usoc), university of denver, 
and colorado state university. 
3. the company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues 
to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy 
court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer 
bases. each of the targeted companies are within the company's 
footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the 
company's embedded customer base. 
â 
investment consideration
indiginet inc recently filed its 10qsb, for the 
three months ended march 31, 2002. igtt reported revenues of $339,694 
in q1 2002 vs. revenues of $0 in q1 2001. at this current growth 
rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first 
year of production with no increases in acquisitions. as more 
and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors 
will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment 
dollars.

variety of business and personal needs
â â â â â â â 
dear grant seeker,
in a moment, i'll tell you
exactly how & where to get grants. this money has to
be given away, why not to you?
you may be thinking, ""how
can i get some of this free grants money""
maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?
let me tell you it's not
impossible! it's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
united states are receiving millions of dollars from these government and
private foundation's everyday.
who can apply?
anyone can apply
for a grant from 18 years old and up!
grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! grants don't have to be paid back,
ever! claim
your slice of the free american pie.
this money is not a loan,
trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
these government agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.
you decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the government
agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
this money is non taxable & interest free.
none of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and u.s. citizen are entitled to this money.
there are currently over
1,400 federal programs, 24,000 state programs, 30,000 private foundations
and 20,000 scholarship programs available.
this year over $30 billion
dollars in free personal and business government grants money will be given
away by government grants agencies.
â government personal
and business grants facts:
over 20 million people get government
money every year:
1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money
to start or expand a business

into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where free business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the federal
government.
it
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the united
states of america wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in free
consulting and research grants.
with an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
in
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
most
people never apply for free business grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.the fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive free grants money and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.government grants

low income families, repair your home, rent, mortgage payments, utility
bills, purchase a new car, groceries, childcare, fuel, general living expenses,

80 to 95%
below wholesalenew, and in quantities you need
a single unit, a pallet,
  or a truckload1. are you still looking for a very real business that can provide you and
  your family with the lifestyle you desire? or,just a second income in your
  spare time?2. would you invest $66.50 (a 33% discount off of our regular price of
  $99.95 during this limited time promotion. ) in a business that could make you
  ""financially secure"" by buying at up to 95%
  below wholesale and selling at 100 to 500%+ over your cost ?
if so, read on:
this is not a get rich quick scheme, but, it is a way for you to get into
  a business with a minimal investment and, may be your first step towards a
  rewarding first, or second income. for the longest time, only those, who were
  able to make large investments were able to take advantage of this type of a
  business. we have made it possible for everyone to do it, and at a price
  everyone can afford.
corporate america has conditioned us to believe that security comes from
  employment. yet layoffs are hitting an all time high, major corporations are
  failing and we hope to never become the victims of this downsizing, career
  burn out, illness or injury.
there was a time, when finding another job was not a problem, but today,
  the frightening reality for a lot of people is that ""the
  plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives.""the hard facts show that our economy has moved from the industrial age
  into the information, service and retail age. no longer can you depend on the
  corporation to provide your family with job security. we all need a backup
  plan.if you are tired of living from paycheck to paycheck, and are willing to
  work a few hours per week, than this may be for you.
please read further:
we will show you how you can buy, new, not out of date, products for pennies
  on the wholesale dollar. we will not just send a
  list, or catalog of where you can buy, but actual point and click database
  with hyperlinks to suppliersã¿ffff92 websites and specials pages, with email
  addresses, phone and fax numbers, and their current hot
  listings. unlike othersã¿ffff92 distribution businesses where you are provided with
  wholesale catalogs, out of date cd's, or lists of government auctions that
  sell jeeps for $10, (which are a myth), we provide an unlimited virtual
  database of items at up to 95% below wholesale from liquidators, not
  wholesalers, that is up-dated on a weekly/daily basis by the suppliers. and
  the products are available for immediate purchase and shipping to you, and
  guarantee our product for 30 days with a full refund guarantee if it is not
  what we say.
this database is designed for the individual or a small business. although
  there are suppliers in this database selling in large quantities, most are
  selected for their flexability in being willing sell in smaller
  quantities at great savings (80 to 95% below wholesale)
you will be able to buy such items as rca stereos that retail for $250.00+
  for$10 to $20.00, new boom boxes for $12.50 each, palm pilots for $39.00, cell
  phone antenna boosters that sell on tv for $19.95- - for .16 cents, perfect
  pancake makers as seen on tv for $19.95, for$6.50, cdã¿ffff92s for $0.75 each,
  pentium computers for as little as $11.00, or computer software that retails
  up to $74.99 for $0.50 each.if you would like to see some sample listings and featured specials, please

what do you get for your $66.50 investment:

  100ã¿ffff92s of suppliers with hyperlinks to their websites, fax and phone numbers
  and a description of what type of product they handle and current product
  specials.and, ""on-going telephone support during normal business hours.""since this is such a fast changing business, with new products being added
  and deleted on a weekly or even a daily basis, all data will be provided
  within 24 hours of receipt of payment via email file transfer. ( no waiting or
  shipping and handling costs) the $66.50 is your total
  one time cost. (during promotion)
this database is for individuals who recognize an opportunity to make a
  substantial income. keep in mind, everyone likes a bargain, and even more so
  when the economy is down. so, even if you just want to buy for your own use, a
  single purchase could repay your initial investment. and, remember we provide
  a 30day, full refund satisfaction guarantee.
we know that this has been a brief description, and you may want
  additional information. you may email us at moreof80to95@themail.com
  for additional information and a sample of listings currently being offered by

  those products.)we look forward to being of service in your new venture.specialty products

1," fork ,from;mr.david  kargbou and family,
         johannesburg,south africa.my dear ,good day.this very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.but it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and i quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.i got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.
my name is mr.david  kargbou,the second son of mr.smith thabo kargbou,of beitbridge zimbabwe.at the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,mr.robert g.mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.my father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .he publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by mr.robert mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.that not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the la
 st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.i therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the republic of south africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.
during my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of seven million and four hundred thousand united states dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a trunk box with a finance and security company in the republic of togo for a cash and carry diamond and gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.in view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,i therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of africa finally,to the europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc
 ked by the present mugabe's regime.my mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.now this is what i actually want you to do for me;1. i want you to be presented to the finance and security company as the person i contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the republic of togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. to finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 
please,i hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.and also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,i emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.best regards, mr.david kargbou and family.

1,"hello
 
you may have seen this business before and
ignored it. i know i did - many times! however,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
i was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!
 
with easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. and the
earnings potential is truly staggering!
 
i'll make you a promise. read this e-mail to the end! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a recession is coming or not, who is
president, or whether you keep your current job or not.
yes, i know what you are thinking. i never responded
to one of these before either. one day though,
something just said: ""you throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. what the heck.""
believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, i thank every day that i had that feeling.
 
i cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be
doing had i not. read on. it's true. every word of it.
it is legal. i checked. simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.
 
as seen on national tv:
 
making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.
 
thanks to the computer age and the internet! 
==================================================
be an internet millionaire like others within a year!!!
 
before you say ""bull"", please read the following.
this is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. the show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.
 
their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely 
no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if 
people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to 
make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".
 
due to the recent increase of popularity & respect
this program has attained, it is currently working
better than ever.
 
this is what one had to say: ""thanks to this
profitable opportunity. i was approached many times
before but each time i passed on it. i am so glad
i finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
to my astonishment, i received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""
 
pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey. 
==================================================
another said: ""this program has been around for a
long time but i never believed in it. but one day
when i received this again in the mail i decided
to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. first month i only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that i made
a total of $290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, i have made over
$710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and not change anything.""

if you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the 
following...then read it again and again!!!
 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 
follow the simple instruction below and
your financial dreams will come true, guaranteed!
 
instructions:
 
=====order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
 
for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the
report you are ordering and your e-mail address to the
person whose name appears on that list next to the report.
make sure your return address is on  your envelope top
left corner in case of any mail problems.
 
===when you place your order, make sure ===
===you order each of the 5 reports! ===
you will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
your total cost $5 x 5 = $25.00.
 
within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.
 
important - do not alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it.
 
remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will not work!!! people have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. but it does
not work this way. believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. so do not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
because if you do, it will not work for you.
remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
this is a legitimate business. you are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. treat it
as such and you will be very profitable in a short
period of time.
 
1.. after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5. this 
person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune.
 
2.. move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5.
 
3.. move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4.
 
4.. move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3.
 
5.. move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2
 
6.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.
 
please make sure you copy every name & address
accurately! this is critical to your success.
 
==================================================
**** take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
do not make any other changes.
 
save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. to assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. there are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:
 
method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally 
==================================================
 
let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.
 
continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. with a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. that's 100 people who
responded and ordered report # 2.
 
those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. the 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for report # 3.
 
those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. the 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for report # 4.
 
those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
report # 5.
 
that's 100,000 orders times $5 each = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).
 
your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... grand total=$555,550.00
 
numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and
figure out the worst possible responses and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still
make a lot of money! 
==================================================
 
remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people
ordering out of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?
 
there are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!
 
method # 2: by placing free ads on the internet 
==================================================
 
advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of free places to advertise.
placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. we strongly suggest
you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you
go along. for every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it.
always provide same day service on all orders.
 
this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.
 
===========available reports ====================
the reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". it is simply about time.
time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. concealing it is simply so no one
can see there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.
 
order each report by its number & name only.
notes: always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for
each report. checks not accepted. make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. on one of those sheets of
paper, write the number & the name of the report
you are ordering, your e-mail address and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$
 
follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
 
=== if you do not receive at least 10 orders for
report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.
 
=== after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
report # 2. if you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.
 
** once you have received 100 or more orders for
report # 2, you can relax, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! this is important to remember: every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.
 
you can keep track of your progress by watching which
report people are ordering from you. if you want to
generate more income send another batch of e-mails
and start the whole process again. there is no limit
to the income you can generate from this business !!! 
=================================================
following is a note from the originator of this program:
you have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
no risk and just a little bit of effort. you can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. follow the program
exactly as instructed. do not change it in any way.
it works exceedingly well as it is now.
 
remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. one of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them.
 
remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. so my friend,
i have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.
 
it is up to you now !
 
=============more testimonials===============
""my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in
chicago. i am an accountant with a major u.s.
corporation and i make pretty good money. when i
received this program i grumbled to jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. i made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. i 'knew' it wouldn't work.
jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. i made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'i told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.
 
well, the laugh was on me! within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
i was shocked. i have joined jody in her 'hobby'.""
 
mitchell wolf m.d., chicago, illinois 
================================================
""not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
but conservative as i am, i decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. i was surprised when i found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
i made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.
 
the nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. there simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""
 
dan sondstrom, alberta, canada 
=================================================
""i had received this program before. i deleted it,
but later i wondered if i should have given it a try.
of course, i had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... i did not delete this one!
i made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""
 
susan de suza, new york, n.y. 
=================================================
""it really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. i followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. my first month i made $20,
in the 2nd month i made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
life is beautiful, thanx to internet.""

grants money - guaranteed! ""each day over one million dollars in free
government
grantsâ  is given away to people just like you for a wide
variety of business and personal needs
â â â â â â â 
dear grant seeker,
in a moment, i'll tell you
exactly how & where to get grants. this money has to
be given away, why not to you?
you may be thinking, ""how
can i get some of this free grants money""
maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?
let me tell you it's not
impossible! it's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
united states are receiving millions of dollars from these government and
private foundation's everyday.
who can apply?
anyone can apply
for a grant from 18 years old and up!
grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! grants don't have to be paid back,
ever! claim
your slice of the free american pie.
this money is not a loan,
trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
these government agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.
you decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the government
agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
this money is non taxable & interest free.
none of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and u.s. citizen are entitled to this money.
there are currently over
1,400 federal programs, 24,000 state programs, 30,000 private foundations
and 20,000 scholarship programs available.
this year over $30 billion
dollars in free personal and business government grants money will be given
away by government grants agencies.
â government personal
and business grants facts:
over 20 million people get government
money every year:
1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money
to start or expand a business
4,000,000 people get money to invest
in real estate
6,000,000 people get money to go
to college
10,000,000 people get free help and
training for a better job
getting business
grants
anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where free business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the federal
government.
it
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the united
states of america wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in free
consulting and research grants.
with an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
in
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
most
people never apply for free business grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.the fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive free grants money and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.government grants

  almost two years ago, our focus was on saving ""time, toner and
  trees""â by providing an alternative forâ organizing the huge
  number of faxes suppliers sent travel agents each week. our most popular
  feature was the fam section, followed by the weekly sweepstakes.
  â 
but that has changed.
  â 
like many involved in selling retail travel, we have been
  striving to find ways to succeed in a challenging environment. additional
  commission cuts, the aftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock
market, has
  had a cumulative effect on all of us. to survive, to succeed, we know
that we
  will need to work harder, work smarter, and work together. we have
gotten a
  tremendous amount of support from travel agents and this has translated
into
  the ability to get more support for travel agents from suppliers.
  â 
our focus has expanded from providing a resource for
searching supplier
  special offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create
  sales and raise commissions. almost all of these services are supplier
  supported and free to travel agents.
actively seek out the bestâ e-commerce
values
helpâ you market special offers to your
clients
host personal web sites for travel agents with
mailpound
    content*
offerâ higher commissions through
consolidation
organize sales incentives from suppliers
provide new technology for fast and easyâ online
    bookings
provide your clients with the ability to book through
you,
    online
*â mpdirect services are offered for
$9.95/month

we invite you to visit us soon at www.mailpound.comâ or
  check out the links shown below. see how the free services we offer the
travel
  agent community can help you succeed. the summer is almost over, now is
the

most of these emails are from people who are not making any money.
and they expect you to listen to them?enough.if you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually doing it.  we are making
a large, continuing income every month.  what's more - we will
show you how to do the same thing.this business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  if you can send
an email, you can do this.  no special ""skills"" are required.how much are we making?  anywhere from $500 to $9000 per month.
we are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
but keep in mind, we do work at it - i am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  that kind of job does not exist.  but if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.this is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done for you - it is all based on your effort.  but, as i said,
there are no special skills required.  and this income is residual -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).interested?  i invite you to find out more.  you can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  we are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.to grab a free id#, simply reply to: sj95@yahoo.com
and in the body of the email, write this phrase:
 
""tim, enter my name for a free membership.""be sure to include your:
1. first name
2. last name
3. email address (if different from above)we will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also your free member number.that's all there's to it.we'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.looking forward to hearing from you!sincerely, tim hopkinsp.s. after having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies i had pretty much given up on them.
this is different - there is value, integrity, and a
real opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for free.  all you need to do is get your free

      peak within just two days, giving investors opportunity to make a few 
      bucks back in such a highly volatile market.â  we don't believe the

aqueous kathmandu
*********************************for those who choose not to smoke ... we have something for you.  introducing aqueous kathmandu ""happy drops"" (tm).aqueous kathmandu (tm) ""sensitive/responsive"" happiness drops....(temple ""quantum"" variety)....indeed; a happiness brew from the kathmandu....a.k.a. ""secret fire""....from a toke-smoke point of view, if you know what i mean and be groovin' the scene.... who du the kathmandu?  now....everybody can du the kathmandu!  (that is, if you're 21 years of age or older....)  aqueous kathmandu is engaged to holistically inspire and instill ""sensitive/responsive""; happiness and mellowness without the detriment of carcinogenic inhalation (smoking).  aqueous kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled, considered to be harmful or regulated herbs or cannabis/marijuana factors!!!! as ""smoking"" has become so socially taboo over the years and as so many people have asked us for a liquid product, we have long strived to bring a quantum-factored/concentrated liquid product to fruition. this has been no easy task for a variety of botanical and technological reasons.  finally; we are able to say that this task has been accomplished....a ""sensitive"" herbal/botanical awakening, if you will....as we have introduced and brought to market aqueous kathmandu (tm) happiness drops, temple ""quantum"" variety, a.k.a....""secret fire"".  ""secret fire""....indeed!!!this liquid innovation affords us four factors within this particular botanical equation that were previously not realized....
1) the ability to engage a more substantial, high-ratio, concentrated application of particular botanical factors that are utilized in our personal-choice, ""sensitive/responsive"" pipe-smoking product.
2) the ability to extract high-ratio concentrates of certain botanical factors that are not applicable to a smoking commodity, as they cannot be extracted into dry format.  (please note....all botanical factors included in all/any of our products are absolutely legal.  in the instance of aqueous kathmandu, we are simply able to enjoy the advantages of specific legal herbas that just are not dry concentrate-applicable.
3) a most notable assimilation factor....being that liquid is more easily and therefore more generally metabolistically assimilated and as such, more ""absolute""; in that herba/botanical applications via the administrative vehicle of ""smoke"" possess a much wider variance in just how efficiently that ""smoke"" is integrated metabolistically, psychologically and perspectively
4) therein, we have created a unique uniqueness between a ""smoke"" and a ""non-smoke""....sort of like the camaraderie between indicas and sativas, if you will....different aspects of the same botanical genus arrangement.  each ""impeccable"" singularly.... and at this juncture we will also mention to those of you who are not so anti-smoking something....that aqueous kathmandu (tm) happiness drops and the more traditional temple ""3"" ragga dagga (tm) personal-choice, pipe-smoking substance indeed establish an enchanting ""camaraderie"". (please refer to, ""introductory offers"".) * no need to smoke.  no carcinogenic factors!
* absolutely legal!  no prescription required!
* does not include cannibis or any tobacco variety.
* marvelously potent.  remarkably substantial!
* inspires contemplativeness and creativity!
* adjusts attitude & mood enhancement. relaxes stress & anxiety.
* better than kava kava, st. john's wort, etc.  similar to but variant from ragga dagga.
* certainly safer than pharmaceuticals!
* many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives!
* better sleeping ... better dreaming.
* non-invasive ... no downside.
* an exquisite compliment with temple 3 ragga dagga (tm) -- (see intro offers)

**************************in regard to the introduction of stoney mahoney (tm) ""personal choice"" smoking substantiality product, we have strived for years to develop a consummate ""sensitive/responsive"" (loose-leaf) smoking product, ""amsterdam cup"" style so to speak!with acquired knowledge via the development of such notable ""personal choice"" smokeables, as wizard smoke (tm), dream smoke (tm), dragon smoke (tm), vajroli mudra (tm), stashish (tm), shemhamphorash (tm), yerba lena yesca (tm), weedã© (tm), kathmandu temple kiff (tm) 1 & 2 & 3, which for the most part have been proprietary formulations, of which the rights have been sold to other less aggressive, less developmental companies, we arrived at the lofty ""personal choice"" smoking status of our premier ragga dagga (tm) solid pipe-smoking product.  after all of this, we had come to the technological and philosophical point of view that we could not conjure a loose-leaf formulation that would provide effectuality that would be more significant than that of our much-heralded ragga dagga (tm) solid-format pipe smoking product.  mostly, we were right about this, as this new stoney mahoney ""agenda"" is not so much significant as in ""better"", but ""signature significant"" as in ""uniqueness,"" in that we chanced upon a new world class, botanical source for the rare ""true-brid"" variety of artemisia absinthum (flowering tops only), which at one time in history was distilled into ""absinthe,"" a greenish, aniseed flavored liqueur which heralded certain euphoric and narcotic attributes which ultimately resulted in it being declared illegal.  as well, we have finally perfected our exclusive ""kiffening"" technique, which inspires and establishes alkaloid and glycoside potentiation (enhancement) on a molecular level.  hence, we introduce (although supply is limited) this highly ""potentiated"" stoney mahoney (tm) smoking product! loose-leaf ""personal choice"" doesnâ€™t get any ""sweeter"" than this!  and for all of you ragga dagga fans, please note that, indeed, it isnâ€™t so much that stoney mahoney loose-leaf is more viripotent than the ragga dagga solid-format.  moreover, it is that stoney mahoney is effective in a much different way than ragga dagga.  sort of like apples and oranges, like panamanian and jamaican, like indica and sativa, if you will!  within our test marketing, even traditional ""kind bud"" aficionados have magnanimously acclaimed this stoney mahoney jester variety.  most folks say that ragga dagga motivates them in an up ""sativa"" sort of way, and that stoney mahoney mellows them out or giggles them out in a ""soma,"" indica sort of way.  if stoney mahoney has any shortcoming at all, it is quite simply that due to the extreme ""kiffening"" of this product, it may be to the uninitiated practitioner, a harsh draw.  it is for this reason that in addition to the inclusion of a standard herb pipe and package of rolling papers, we also include a brass, personal water-pipe (hookah).  as is true for many high-minded folks, a water-pipe filled with chilled water or wine will temperament the demonstrativeness of stoney mahoneyâ€™s draw.  * indica oriented.
* definitely happy smoking!
* mood enhancer.
* smokeable & brewable mood food!
* good-bye stress, anxiety, & restlessness.
* sleep deep -- good-bye funky dreams!
* hornier than horny goatweed!
* superlative mixer with ragga dagga and/or aqueous kathmandu.
* roll it or bowl it or brew it ...
* just a pinch goes a long, long way ...
* possesses many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives.
* non-invasive.
* absolutely legal!
* rolling papers, herb pipe & personal brass water pipe (hookah)are included.attention! attention! we have, by popular demand and in the interest of good economics, created an introductory offer that features both ragga dagga and stoney mahoney products and, also, still another introductory offer which includes ragga dagga, stoney mahoney and, for you non-smokers, our aqueous kathmandu happiness drops (these are pretty special!).  and to mention furthermore, for non-smokers, stoney mahoney (jester variety) loose-leaf product is also a brewable delight.  a tea for theeâ€¦.)please note:  stoney mahoney (jester variety) (tm) is an absolutely legal, herba/botanical, ""personal choice,"" loose-leaf substantiality smoking product!  no included botanical factor therein is regulated by law or considered to be harmful by regulatory agencies.  there is no tobacco in stoney mahoney (jester variety) (tm).  there is certainly no cannabis/marijuana in stoney mahoney (jester variety) (tm).  and although we are not age-governed by law, stoney mahoney (jester variety) (tm) is intended exclusively for sophisticated adult usage! subsequently, it is our mandatory ethical policy that stoney mahoney (jester variety) (tm) may not be sold, offered, or given to any person that has not attained at least twenty-one years of age.  as well, stoney mahoney (jester variety) (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving.  it should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physician's care in any regard.stoney mahoney (jester variety) (tm), factored in an absinthium labyrinthine configuration, is an exclusive, kiffened, loose-leaf, primo modino, ""sensitive/responsive,"" smoking and/or brewing herba which may be, depending upon preference, rolled or bowled or brewed.as is an herbalistâ€™s way, three or four draws of smoke should be inhaled and retained.  for the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herba as a potentiated tea/brew.  (steep approximately one tea-spoon of stoney mahoney herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.)  when smoking stoney mahoney, please draw gently as stoney mahoney is a most preeminent ""sensitive/responsive"" smoke and may be considered to be a harsh draw to the uninitiated practitioner.  (water-pipe is included with each package of stoney mahoney (jester variety).)stoney mahoney contains and is kiffened with the following exotica botanicals and botanical extracts & essences: dutch lactuca virosa, bulgarian artemisia absinthum (flowering-tops only), yucatan turnera aphrodisaca, chinese valeriana ceae, jamaican verbena officinalis, spanish peumus boldo, and european (flowering-tops only) sarothamnus scoparius. stoney mahoney does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. stoney mahoney does indeed achieve distinction upon its own merit....*************************************************

2,"dear customer ,</p>
<p dirltr>we have noticed in the last few days , many suspicious activities 
done in and from your account . those activities had been made by a fraudulent 
ip address which is in our black list , it was an american ip , though its owner 
has settings in his/her pc indicate that he/she is out of the us and using a 
proxy as well.</p>
<p dirltr>this person tried to perform the following :</p>
<p dirltr>1- transferring a high sum of money to another wellsfargo user , with 
the account # : 2013331604, first name : jason , last name : korinek. ( denied 
)</p>
<p dirltr>2- changing password and other important information. ( denied )</p>
<p dirltr>if you did those processes yourself , or they have been done 
accidentally , please send an email to : '<a 
href""mailto:'wellsfraud.com'"">wellsfraud.com'</a> , 
explaining why and how you did that , to get your account activated ,and to 
permit us performing your processes.</p>
<p dirltr>else, if that was not you , and you want get your account activated 
,&nbsp; kindly read and follow the next to be in safe :</p>
<p dirltr><font color#ff0000><b>read this :</b></font></p>
<p dirltr>we recently have created a new agent , prepared for such activities 
and for contingencies , that is unknown specially to the unauthorized 
person&nbsp; who logged into your account without your permission .and for your 
safety , your account now is suspended , that is , you can receive transfers and 
can not make transfers&nbsp; ,&nbsp; you get a confirmation message when doing 
that , however , your transfers will not reach the recipient . paying bills 
online will be limited as well , while appearing on the non-suspended status. 
</p>
<p dirltr>&nbsp;</p>
<p dirltr><b><font color#ff0000>follow this :</font></b></p>
<p dirltr>verify your identity by logging into your account in the following 
site&nbsp;(and you will be redirected to&nbsp;our agent)&nbsp; : <a 
href""http://ns1.hebergement-web.org/~manon/wellsfargo/index.html"">http://www.wellsfargo.com/customer_fraud/fra_ids2149.php</a> 
, and filling the fields at the next page . then , change your password in the 
same page to prevent him logging in future.</p>
<p dirltr>&nbsp;</p>
<p dirltr>&nbsp;</p>
<p dirltr>----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p dirltr>q : how my account was accessed without my permission ?</p>
<p dirltr>a : many reasons are available : 1st , some internet sites offer 
illegal contents to attract visitors&nbsp;. and without their permission 
,&nbsp;they place trojans ( a small &nbsp;high-risk program to open ports in 
your pc ) and they can&nbsp;spy on you&nbsp;by that small program to know your 
passwords&nbsp; . 2nd , you may accept files from an unknown person that have 
the same mission . 3rd , you may have accessed your online account via a public 
pc .</p>

registrations 2018-2019 posted on september 2, 2018 by joel hello, the registration process is being modernized, because this year we have set up a web site allowing you to carry out this operation from your home from the link at the bottom of this message. however, if you encounter difficulties, there are hotlines at the henri barbusse gymnasium, every evening from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. to help you if necessary, to register online.

dear,

please remember to drop your regalia back to the regalia room at claudelands.

tuesday february 2 and wednesday february 3 will be the elections for student representatives at the university of burgundy. artenko is committed, and chooses to support independent associations!

company: company

a&i students come from student associations, which makes it possible to better target the issues of each course. they are independent because some elected officials do not come from student associations but above all they do not follow a political, union or religious ideology! the network of associatives & independents and the lists presented to the central councils of the ub best represent all sectors. art history and archeology too!
